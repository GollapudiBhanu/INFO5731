3,3,Wow!,"I was not expecting that, I had visions of a film along the same lines as Snake Eyes, that was an out of date bagel, this was a four course banquet.

Fast paced, energetic, and relentless, not particularly the genre I normally go to, or enjoy, but I loved every second of it, a visual masterpiece. Superb acting, terrific musics, but it's produced in such a magical way, it is stunning.

I plan on seeing this again, just to understand a few bits a little more.

Go and watch it, you'll love it, 9/10.","I was not expecting that, I had visions of a film along the same lines as Snake Eyes, that was an out of date bagel, this was a four course banquet.

4,4,Precious ... ten times,"Of course I am just riffing off, teasing and making fun of certain things with my summary line. Though there is some truth in there too - especially if you consider the last third of the movie - quite fantastical, pun intended.

But there is so much more here. And while you may have seen the bus scene already (I imagine many times), it still is quite the highlight and works wonders! Because there is even more to it than the trailer/teaser revealed! As is with the plot and the characters of the movie.

I was able to watch it on an Imax screen and let me tell you ... wow! But also wow and much respect to Marvel and Feige and anyone involved that they dared to make the first ten minutes or so in chinese! And throwing a lot of chinese terms (slang?) in there as well - throughout! That gives it a touch of authenticity. How immigrants in America or anywhere else in the world grew up. I do the same with my Greek and German/English.

It is also nice and while I am prone to be sarcastic, I really think it's a good thing to have such a major and big representation - especially nowadays with Anti-Asian hate/crime rising. All because of people blaming China and people of China for a virus ... the movie does not have that as a topic, it is entertainment after all, but in every promo and interview that the actors were involved it was something that was mentioned. Good for them and good for us, that this was made.

I am a bit biased when it comes to the MCU and this did get a pure theatrical release, instead of the Black Widow treatment (which also was available on Disney plus and the cinemas at the same time). So there is not issue when it comes to that. And if you can watch it on the big screen - you will not be dissapointed! Now waiting for the other stuff to drop ... especially after the mid credit scene, that is such a tease ... the after the credits scene might also hint at something, but the bigger tease was midway through the credits (actually almost at the beginning of them to be honest).

Sit back and enhoy the movie and the really funny characters ... and quite a few familiar faces. Some from the MCU and previous entries but also some from Asian cinema! Well done!","Of course I am just riffing off, teasing and making fun of certain things with my summary line.

6,6,Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,,
7,7,The best Marvel movie so far...,"Having seen the trailer for the 2021 Marvel action movie ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" I must admit that of course I was going to watch it, but I feared it would just be another run-of-the-mill-over-the-top-CGI-fest-but-barred-of-proper-contents Marvel movie. Yet, I opted to sit down and watch it, on the notion that it was a Marvel movie. But also because of the cast that starred in it.

And yeah, this movie was over the top in terms of CGI. Of course it was, because it is a Marvel movie after all. But luckily this movie broke the formula of the archetypical Marvel movie and this actually turned out to be the best Marvel movie so far. Well, at least in my opinion. Why? Well, because of the storyline and the fact that it mixed Asian culture and lore into the Marvel cinematic universe, and it was a much needed addition to an otherwise Western-focused series of movies.

The storyline told in ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"", as written by Dave Callaham, Destin Daniel Cretton and Andrew Lanham was certainly entertaining. And the movie didn't really have a dull moment, despite the fact that it was a movie that ran for 132 minutes. I thoroughly enjoyed the entire movie from beginning to end. And for me, this was a storyline with proper contents to it, that also included interesting characters and creatures.

Visually then ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" blew me away. The CGI team really worked their magic with this movie and brought it to life in a very visually fulfilling way. Lots of nice details and jaw-dropping special effects. And the creature designs in the movie were off the charts, I really enjoyed seeing those brought to life on the screen.

The character gallery in ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" was interesting, and that applies for both the villain and good guy side.

And they had such a great cast ensemble put together for ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"", with the likes of Asian cinema heavy weighters such as Tony Chiu-Wai Leung, Michelle Yeoh and Wah Yuen. But the movie was also nicely carried by Simu Liu, whom I was not familiar with prior to this movie. And also having Awkwafina in the movie was just brilliant, because she put on a spot on performance with her comedy sidekick character. And it was interesting and nice to see Ben Kingsley return to reprise his character of Trevor Slattery.

""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" is a good combination of action and narrative storytelling, which made for a very wholesome movie. And it should be said that the action sequences were breathtaking to behold, so very, very nicely choreographed and executed on the screen, taking that traditional Wuxia elements seen in Asian movies and mixing it in with the archetypical Marvel Western-based superhero movies.

I was more than genuinely entertained by ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" and it is certainly a movie that bolsters Marvel's hold for me, as their movies tend to be super flashy with spectacular effects, but rather hollow in terms of proper entertainment and storytelling.

My rating of ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" lands on a well-deserved nine out of ten stars. Director Destin Denial Cretton ensured that this 2021 movie takes the role of the single best Marvel movie to date for me.","Having seen the trailer for the 2021 Marvel action movie ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" I must admit that of course I was going to watch it, but I feared it would just be another run-of-the-mill-over-the-top-CGI-fest-but-barred-of-proper-contents Marvel movie.

9,9,Ten Years too Late,,
10,10,Indeed legendary,"It's been ten years since Shang-Chi(Liu, charming, stoic) last saw his father, and leader of the criminal empire The Ten Rings, Wenwu(Leung, charismatic enough that we feel a lot of empathy for him, even when he does terrible things that we desperately want him to stop doing). That was also when he last spent time with his sister, Xialing(Zhang, a badass who deserves more screen time. Honestly, I'd be very surprised if she didn't, in future projects). He's joined by his friend Katy(Awkwafina, quirky, providing a lot of comic relief, something I'm told she's in general adept at), for what can best be described as a tense reunion, which allows the movie to really mine the family melodrama, one of the best elements it has. I won't give away exactly what the antagonist intends to do, only that our hero has to stop him. However, he has to figure out how, maybe even if, that is even possible.

Not quite, yet almost ""Black Panther for Asian audiences"", this does a lot for representation(including for women. Some of the best characters in this are female. In addition to the two that I've already mentioned, there is also Ying Nan(Yeoh, wise)), it is positively drenched in Chinese culture(the third act, while in ways it feels like it belongs to a completely different film than the first two, takes an especially deep dive into that. Ultimately, it is presented through a Western lens, and clearly we need to go further in this direction, still, it is a big deal that they put so much of it in an estimated $150 to 200 million major blockbuster, which will be seen by millions of people who would never consider watching an art picture, especially one focusing on a group they don't belong to), to the point where countless times, when it makes sense, major characters in this speak Mandarin to each other, rather than English, which it is subtitled into. And ""don't worry"", for those who think that the following is important: there are white people on screen, and they aren't made out to be ""less than"".

The action(each sequence of which feels distinct, belongs with the rest, and is memorable) pays tribute to many different kinds of martial arts films, acknowledging that they are standing on the shoulders of giants. Jackie Chan, wuxia, etc. The choreography is matched in skill by the cinematography. Not only are we seeing incredible fighting, the camera is dynamic, celebrating and highlighting how incredible it is. That *is* why you hire Bill Pope, the director of photography on the Matrix trilogy, two of Sam Raimi's Spider-Man entries, Darkman and Team America. The special effects are excellent. There are some issues with pacing, and certainly a chunk of this is composed almost entirely of flashbacks.

This features relatively brief but highly concentrated, surprisingly graphic gore(you know, there was a time when the fact that it's happening to beings that clearly are not human, wasn't enough to get away with this kind of thing with a PG-13 rating. Pepperidge Farm remembers), as well as a little strong language. I recommend this to any fan of comic book movie adaptations, and people passionate about diversity hiring. 8/10.","It's been ten years since Shang-Chi(Liu, charming, stoic) last saw his father, and leader of the criminal empire The Ten Rings, Wenwu(Leung, charismatic enough that we feel a lot of empathy for him, even when he does terrible things that we desperately want him to stop doing).

11,11,Very enjoyable,,
12,12,"Visually stunning, looking forward to the next one","Without spoiling anything as this story stands by itself there's going to be a sequel and I really look forward to that. It was that good in my humble opinion. Visually it was just stunning, great CGI's, very well choreographed fighting scenes, and a story that was most entertaining to watch. Some might find it over the top but it's a Marvel so what do you expect? To me this is one of Marvels best movies yet if not the best. The acting was good as well, and that from the whole cast. I never heard of Shang-Chi before but from now he has one more fan. Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings won't disappoint a lot of people, unless you're just not into this genre of movies. A must see for the fans.","Without spoiling anything as this story stands by itself there's going to be a sequel and I really look forward to that. It was that good in my humble opinion.

13,13,great start but the fictionary world didn't fit in for me,"Started like a mix between martial art and the marvel universe. I found it something special and liked it a lot just until the journey starts and another world opens. From there on we came into a fiction world with dragons and monsters.

It's there that this flick lost my attention towards the story. It takes a while before the action comes back in. But once the fights are on, the effects are really stunning.

Mixed feelings aboutthe result, not bada fter all but with the other world coming in, it lost some points in the rating for me.

Nevertheless, some funny parts here and there added and they worked out fine.

15,15,A Marvel for the whole family.,"""The US government was almost toppled by a pretender named after an orange."" Wenwu (Tony Leung)

This quote is typical of the light-hearted but also serious addition to the MCU that is Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings. Although Marvel has always been less serious than DC, this time it leaves Superman and Batman to cry in their capes. Sweet superhero Sean/Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) has more humanity than almost any other hero, and he uses his martial arts only when pressed.

The opening sequence on a bus (you can see the bad coming from other cinematic bus rides such as in Nobody) is rousing and entertaining. It has a fight sequence I laughed through because of its ballet-like composition but satisfying because it sets up character and motivation.

When things get heavy, and they do because Sean must confront and potentially kill his 1000-year-old mobster dad, Wenwu, Awkwafina's Katy, Sean's girlfriend, is there with amusing one-liners throughout the adventure, right down to a life-saving shot in the big ending battle scene.

Director Destin Daniel Cretton deftly orchestrates his fights and his characters' lines with the authority of a much more seasoned filmmaker. He never loses sight of the central motif-the affirmation of family primacy, so that the potential chaos of a giant cast and multiple plot strands hosts a unity glued by character and dialogue.

17,17,The legend of the ten Marvel movies a year for all eternity.,"'Shang-Chi And The Legend Of The Ten Rings (2021)' is, essentially, exactly what you expect it to be. Not only does it feel like a Marvel movie, it feels like a literal Disney movie as well. This is often detrimental to the overall affair, as the piece should have been much more unique than it ultimately is, and it makes for a much less interesting watch overall. However, the formula it follows has provided plenty of success in the past; this time is no exception. Its highs are where you'd expect them to be, as are its lows, and there is an undeniable sense of fun, albeit cookie-cutter fun, to be had. The film is an entertaining action adventure that follows a young man whose criminal father calls him and his sister back home in order to lay siege to the mystical village he believes is holding his wife, the protagonist's mother, hostage. The villain's motivation is a little underexplored yet entirely understandable. It comes from a believable emotional place and is more satisfying because of it. The relationship between the lead and his no-good dad isn't explored as much as it could be, though, and the flick generally has a bit of a theming issue. The piece tries to tie its events directly into the wants and needs of its lead characters, but it does so in an unsatisfyingly half-baked way and honestly would probably have been better if it played itself as more of a straightforward adventure ala most of the 'Mission: Impossible (1996-)' series. Still, the touches of character development are appreciated and each lead player is written to be as likeable as possible. This, combined with the amicable performances, means that you care about the heroes even though you don't have all that much reason to. This keeps you invested in their stories throughout. The highlight of the entire affair is, for sure, its action. For the most part, the picture stays towards the right end of the practical to CG spectrum. The fights are never exactly realistic, per se, but they're based on competent choreography and clean camerawork. They're, more often than not, really entertaining. Sadly, the flick inches closer and closer towards the wrong end of the aforementioned spectrum the longer it goes on. By the time it reaches its finale (which gives me major 'Fast And Furious Presents Hobbs And Shaw (2019)' vibes for some reason), it's clear that the balance it previously achieved is going to go out of the window. Sure enough, its climactic battle is an entirely computer-generated affair; it isn't all that compelling and goes directly against what made the movie so enjoyable to begin with. No matter how hard it tries to disguise it, it still ends with a big blue beam in the sky. Still, the finale isn't exactly bad. It's just annoyingly intangible and feels a little forced in, even (as do the rather cringe-worthy post-credits scenes). Ultimately, this is a generic yet entertaining experience. Its charming acting and exciting action are clearly its highlights, and its weakest aspects are still decent enough. It's a good movie. However, I can't deny that Marvel fatigue is becoming more and more pertinent in my mind. You know what you're going to get before you get it. Plus, the studio's insistence that it has to perforate every single outing with references to other, almost entirely irrelevant fare is really annoying. Although most of their movies are at least okay, I find myself not caring at all about them. That's sad, really, considering that the MCU has produced some genuinely great pictures in the past. 7/10.","'Shang-Chi And The Legend Of The Ten Rings (2021)' is, essentially, exactly what you expect it to be.

By the time it reaches its finale (which gives me major 'Fast And Furious Presents Hobbs And Shaw (2019)' vibes for some reason), it's clear that the balance it previously achieved is going to go out of the window. Sure enough, its climactic battle is an entirely computer-generated affair; it isn't all that compelling and goes directly against what made the movie so enjoyable to begin with. No matter how hard it tries to disguise it, it still ends with a big blue beam in the sky. Still, the finale isn't exactly bad. It's just annoyingly intangible and feels a little forced in, even (as do the rather cringe-worthy post-credits scenes). Ultimately, this is a generic yet entertaining experience. Its charming acting and exciting action are clearly its highlights, and its weakest aspects are still decent enough. It's a good movie. However, I can't deny that Marvel fatigue is becoming more and more pertinent in my mind. You know what you're going to get before you get it. Plus, the studio's insistence that it has to perforate every single outing with references to other, almost entirely irrelevant fare is really annoying. Although most of their movies are at least okay, I find myself not caring at all about them. That's sad, really, considering that the MCU has produced some genuinely great pictures in the past. 7/10."
18,18,Fun martial arts action-comedy with some dragon ex machina,"After a flashback, this movie jumps to a couple of slackers, Shaun and Katy, with Shaun proving during a wild bus ride that he is much more than a car attendant. Soon they're on a globe hoping adventure with world-saving dimensions.

The martial arts choreography is terrific, from the opening forest fight through that fantastic bus bit to the final hand-to-hand battle (followed by the big special effects battle seemingly required in every Marvel film). Fights are funny and exciting and that final battle is truly suspenseful.

The cast is also excellent. Awkwafina is as funny as ever, Michelle Yeoh and Tony Leung bring all their seasoned expertise to their roles, and the actors are don't know are also first rate.

Although ... in the case of Simu Liu, who plays Shaun/Shang-Chi, I have no strong opinion. He's a pleasant every man who handles the action scenes well but seems less mythic hero than ""genial best friend of the main character."" With all the other talent on screen he doesn't manage to leave much of an impression, but on the bright side I don't object to him.

The story is fun, the movie does a good job of mixing humor, action, and tragical reminiscences the pace is terrific, and man there are some great fights. Recommended.","After a flashback, this movie jumps to a couple of slackers, Shaun and Katy, with Shaun proving during a wild bus ride that he is much more than a car attendant.

19,19,my eyes couldn't handle the sheer awesomeness on the screen,"Watch this in IMAX!!!! The entire movie has an expanded aspect ratio. You're watching about 70% of the image on normal screens, plus on way smaller screens with worse speakers. I promise, it's worth it

WOWOWOWOWOW. This movie blew me away. I love it. A LOT. From beginning to end. Everything. I walked out of the movie so hyped, silent-screaming under my mask as i walked to the car. It's been a while since i walked out of a movie this happy. I have so much to say.

I love the MCU (a lot), but there are a few things that are frequently lacking. One of them is good fight scenes. They always have awesome action scenes, but specifically fight scenes are usually pretty good, only great in a few movies like civil war and winter soldier. And in general, fight scenes in American movies pale in comparison to Asian cinema (Ip man, The Raid Redemption, anything Jackie Chan).

The fight scenes in this movie.... how do i describe it... amazing martial arts that's fast but clear, filmed in creative and astonishing ways without a hint of shaky cam or quick cuts, against stunningly beautiful backdrops... phenomenal. And they continuously focus on the fights instead of cutting to a different scene after 10 seconds like i've noticed in the MCU.

This is BY FAR the best fighting in the MCU and it's not even close. Has to be up there with the John Wick series and Netflix's Daredevil as some of the best we've seen in America lately. I loved the first major fight scene so much that i was worried it would be the best one of the movie, far too early. Lol. I be stupid sometimes

Another frequent flaw in the MCU is lack of compelling villain. Nope. Awesome awesome awesome. That's all i'll say.

Another of my frequent complaints is that the musical scores, with some exceptions, don't stand out. I think they heard. They're on a good streak with the shows and Black Widow. It's not as amazing as the Loki score but i liked it. It felt unique to this new franchise.

Still so much more to say, need to go faster. This is one of the best, maybe THE best, story in the MCU, especially the way it's told. I loved all the characters, i loved all the casting choices, i loved the performances. There are scenes of dialogue that gave me goosebumps. All the emotional moments hit. All the callbacks hit. There isn't anything that didn't work for me. There's no such thing as a perfect movie, but mannnnnn.

Lmao i didn't mention the cinematography. Why would i wait this long? It's MESMERIZING. A lot. Throughout. It's candy for your eyes.

It's also nice to see well-written comedy with jokes relevant to the scene and characters, that feels organic. As opposed to the ""insert joke here"" method we've been seeing more of, especially in Far From Home.

What's the opposite of formulaic? That's this movie. I never knew what to expect next (helps that i didn't watch a single trailer, they ruin movies). Definitely doesn't feel like a typical MCU movie. It has it's own unique tone and feel and character.

Continuing what i said in my headline, i have this thing where i get goosebumps and start tearing up, not from an emotional moment, but from a scene being so incredible, especially action scenes. Don't know why it happens, don't know if it happens to other ppl. Maybe it's partly because i can't risk blinking. That happened in this movie numerous times. Like ""this is the coolest thing i've ever seen in my life."" hyperbole, but mannnnn

after endgame finished phase 3 (yes i know spider-man), i was so happy and satisfied with the MCU. But i wasn't sure they could ever recapture that magic again. I knew i would watch everything and it would probably mostly be awesome. But i wasn't expecting top-tier stuff any more. Lol. I be stupid sometimes. I am ecstatic to have that notion obliterated. As of now, this is a top 6 MCU movie for me. Wow

All in all, i adore this movie. You may wonder why i wouldn't give it a 10 after all this raving. 10s are super rare for me, only 13 of them, and i watch thousands of movies. Interstellar, inception, mad max fury road, etc. Movies that shouldn't even be called movies. My 9s are rare too, they are my favorite movies. 10s are my favorites of my favorites. Only superhero movies i've given 10s are dark knight, dark knight rises and civil war.

If you're still reading, wow you're awesome! I think this is my longest review other than Interstellar.

I'm still in such a good mood. I can't wait to watch it again, in IMAX. I want to wait a week so it feels fresher, but i might not be able to!

We get some absolutely amazing fight scenes which seem right out of a classic Chinese martial arts movie. My only complaint is that it is a bit too long. It's still amazing with gorgeous designs of the creatures. It truly is a unique film to have a mostly all-Asian cast in a superhero movie.

Here we go...

I'm not feeling this movie. It starts with promise but It lost me after Wong vs Abomb.

The fighting is exciting. The movie lacks excitement though. It's a plain dull movie.

It's about a Karate master and... yeah the movie lost me and I have know idea what it's about. This is the first mcu film that I lost interest for midway. Even Im3 wasn't so bad because I lost interest from the very beginning.

Gotg2, mcu Spiderman 1/2 and IM3 are still the worse in mcu. Shang Chi just joined the club.

A movie so full of emptiness that it makes an empty box jealous

I'm not sure how this is a 7. Fans and the average movie goer should also be held responsible for horrible movies.

This movie ain't a 7 even if you watched this movie as blind and drunk.

They tried to be funny by having Wong be rude by drinking the couple's drink at the end credit scene. That wasn't funny at all. Wizard or not.

Speaking of funny, I didn't laugh once. When I used to watch these movies in theatres, the audience often told me when I should have laughed. I watched it at home, therefore I didn't know my cue of when to laugh.

The mcu needs to chill with the daddy issue plot

THOR Loki daddy issue Black Panta daddy issues Stark Daddy issues Star lord Daddy issues Ultron daddy issues Nebula and Gamora daddy issues Shang daddy issue Wasp daddy issues Scott langs daughter Daddy issues

36,36,"Epic, stunning, and a strong powerhouse story.","5 out of 5 stars.

Shang-Chi and the legend of the Ten Rings is an awesome and exciting mcu film that brings the stunning world with the asian culture. I will say i enjoyed this more than the previous mcu film Black Widow. Shang Chi introduces a new mcu character played by Simu Liu. And Awkwafina which is also a fun addition. While they are being chased by an organization called ten rings. Lead by his father Tony Leung. While Shang Chi learns his abilities and the ten rings. Before his father is trying to use that power for a personal reason.

Great epic plot. Shang Chi and Katy (Awkwafina) enter a hidden world Ta Lao where there is magical mythical creatures. Is like a wow stunning moment when you first see Wakanda in Black Panther. The film does give an emotional story build up and a villain that can be relatable.

The cast ensemble is great. Simu Liu did great with the character along with Awkwafina as his friend. Meng'er Zhang, Michelle Yeoh, Benedict Wong, Florian Munteanu, and Tong Leung all did great.

The set designs and visual effects are stunning and great. Can be colorful at moments. The music score was good as well. The action sequences are great and exciting. Every set piece had an awesome martial arts choreography which was well shot with the cinematography. Director did a great job in capturing the action and fight sequences. Even with the epic climax of the dragon battle.

There are two mid and post credit scene which sets up for further films and has a fun nod to the mcu.

I will say Shang Chi is a great exciting addition and i found the film to be very fast moving. Action packed. And a great family conflict story that is emotionally driven.","5 out of 5 stars.

Shang-Chi and the legend of the Ten Rings is an awesome and exciting mcu film that brings the stunning world with the asian culture. I will say i enjoyed this more than the previous mcu film Black Widow. Shang Chi introduces a new mcu character played by Simu Liu. And Awkwafina which is also a fun addition. While they are being chased by an organization called ten rings. Lead by his father Tony Leung. While Shang Chi learns his abilities and the ten rings. Before his father is trying to use that power for a personal reason.

37,37,A Marvel-ous martial arts joy,"Showing no signs of slowing down hot off the heels of Black Widow, a raft of well-received Disney+ series and arriving not too far in front of the hotly anticipated The Eternals, Marvel continues to put in work that puts many other wheelhouses too shame, with the marital arts infused Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, yet another entry into the brands increasingly loaded catalogue of quality blockbuster releases.

It's hard to pinpoint exactly what Marvel keep doing to maintain the momentum that started all those years ago with 2008's Iron Man, it's absolutely correct when many say a lot of these origin stories and event pictures follow a very set formula from A to B, but with an ability to attract some of the best actors working in the industry today and handpicking a raft of some of the most exciting Hollywood filmmakers around, Marvel have once more struck gold with the incredibly fun and inventive Shang-Chi.

Quite possibly the most visually sumptuous Marvel film yet, sometimes feeling as if Marvel has meet with Ang Lee/Yimou Zhang and in my mind the Marvel film that features the best choregraphed action scenes yet from the spectacle heavy brand, Shang-Chi is a big screen blast that is freshly directed by the upcoming Destin Daniel Cretton who here has got his just rewards after his great debut Short Term 12 and the sadly undervalued The Glass Castle came before this big-budgeted ride.

Infusing his film with a great energy and charm that is enhanced by the work of leads Simu Liu (in a career launching turn) as our likable hero Shaun/Shang-Chi, Awkwafina (doing her usual but fun schtick) as Shaun's bestie Katy and Tony Leung as the unfortunate villain of the piece Xu Wenwu, Cretton has turned out to be the perfect choice to start off the cinematic journey of the fist swinging Shang-Chi and helps instill in his film some nice differences to what we've come to expect from comic book blockbusters of the modern era.

Most notably for the film is the exciting use of hand to hand combat that is delivered spectacularly in two stand out sequences on board a moving bus and then bettered alongside a high rise building in Macau, both these set pieces are easily some of the most noteworthy of any Marvel film yet while also benefiting the film other than its Asian infused eccentricities is the fun relationship between Shang-Chi and Katy than never bothers with adding extra baggage to add weight to their believable and fun friendship.

If there was a major drawback to Shang-Chi's many wins it is in an overdrawn finale, a major problem many have acknowledged previously when it comes to Marvel films, Cretton and his team can't quite stick the landing for Shang-Chi with it being a little too long in the tooth for its own good and slightly overblown and while it features some incredible imagery and technical wizardry, the films rip-roaring start and strong middle section gives way too something lesser.

Final Say -

Another huge win for Marvel who have here with the help of director Destin Daniel Cretton and his talented cast, created an instantly likable cinematic universe that provides the comic kings with one of their most unique and exciting playgrounds yet.

38,38,Not bad,"The opening fight scene is worth the watch, but the cameos steal the show. I won't go in to detail. The Marvel geeks will know what I mean, because there are plenty to count even the hidden ones.

The movie is good and I like the casting. The direction is okay but the cinematography is the best.

The ending is anti climatic. I found it to be cliche. However it is worth the watch. It is nice to see a movie like this and I believe it is a good addition to your watch list.","The opening fight scene is worth the watch, but the cameos steal the show. I won't go in to detail.

39,39,Yet another superb stand-alone superhero flick in MCEU's kitty.,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (2021) : Brief Review -

Yet another superb stand-alone superhero flick in MCEU's kitty. MCEU's new phase never looked so promising but their products are delivering Better than expected. That Spider Man flick in 2019, right after Endgame, changed many perceptions about Marvel's future and even though couple of their recent series like 'Wanda Vision' and 'Loki' couldn't emerge as clear winners, they have set a solid base for upcoming new stories. Shang-Chi is a new start by all means. Not only because it comes under new phase but mainly because it is a stand-alone film and with a new superhero who is more like using traditional combat methods along with ancient superpowers. When Captain America or Black Panther begun as Stand-alone films, they promised too much and thankfully fulfilled it. Shang-Chi does the same. It may not promise too much like Steve Rogers and Wakanda stories but the point where it ends surely gives us hints of new assembled version of superheroes in Multiverse. Shang-Chi, the master of unarmed weaponry-based Kung Fu, is forced to confront his past after being drawn into the Ten Rings organization. The film has major portion covered by Family values and hence, it may look predictable but does not bore at all. Yes, few scenes are outdated and too dramatic as if we are watching a Superhero Film made in 90s but let's just forget those weak points as Shang Chi has excelled in Visual spectacle. The screenplay could have been better in the second half when the big War was supposed to take place but it actually looks tiny one except for those two humongous dragons which might remind you of 'The Hobbit'. Performances by Simu Li, Awkwafina, Meng'er Zhang, Fala Chen, Florian Munteanu are fine according to less potential available for the roles. Actually, the humour and tone of these characters was great. They all looked normal people when they were not fighting and even though the film has ancient refrences, the character don't actually go too deep to become expressive. Director Destin Daniel Cretton seemed slightly off track in the beginning when he tries to humanise all the characters with that typically teenage humor but as the film goes ahead, he recovers from the childish entanglement. With super explosive climax he surely makes up for his mistakes, rather makes us forgive it. Overall, Shang Chi is another superb entertainer for Marvel Fanboys and even neutrals are gonna enjoy it.

RATING - 7/10*

40,40,This could've been great if it wasn't for the cheesy writing.,"The story was riddled with holes and plot issues. Since when does Awkwafina's pedestrian character all of a sudden get invited to become part of the MCU team? What's her super power... stupidity? Don't get me wrong, I love her, but her character was lazily written. Then there's the whole daddy issues dynamic - Shang is with him, then against, then with etc.. Then we have these ridiculous dragons fighting, where one scores some power crystals and becomes stronger! This is just infantile lazy writing. There was zero shock value or anything spectacular in the entire runtime, with tedious long middle acts and a bumbling third act. The jokes were cliched and not funny. The funniest parts were Ben Kingsley's character, (of whom was in this for what reasons??) and the ending to go Karaoke - which was the only time I actually cracked a chuckle. You'd think with three writers we'd have something cohesive and coherent. But instead of a Marvel superhero story, we got a Disney evil vs good with dragons thrown into the mix. It's as if they tried too hard to create the Asian version of Black Panther.

It's a shame, because the directing and cinematography were spot on, and great S/VFX - although a little overboard with the CGI i.e. Dragons. The martial arts choreography was outstanding (although again, overboard after the awesome bus scene), and the casting and performances were excellent, especially Leung, who pretty much carried the film on his shoulders. It's a 7/10 from me.","The story was riddled with holes and plot issues. Since when does Awkwafina's pedestrian character all of a sudden get invited to become part of the MCU team?

41,41,8 Rings out of 10,"For the first time in a couple of years, since 2019's ""Captain Marvel"" the MCU introduces us to a brand new hero. Simu Liu who, rather impressively, first asked for the role on Twitter brings us Shang-Chi in a film that perhaps does have some issues with it's ending, but ultimately is a fun, funny ride of the type Marvel have been perfecting for the last 13 years.

Talented, but somewhat aimless, Shaun (Simu Liu) lives in San Francisco working as a valet with his friend Katy (Awkwafina). When he's attacked on a bus, he's forced back into the world of his father, a ruthless terrorist Xu Wenwu (Tony Chiu-Wai Leung). First visiting his sister, then returning to the Ten Rings compound, Shang-Chi decides to use his skills to defend his late mothers sacred homeland against invasion from his father and for control of ten mystical arm rings, weapons that grant their owner immortality and unearthly power.

If ""Black Widow"" was considered a wobble for the MCU, despite the fact I thought that it's a perfectly fine film, then it was important to come back with something that was undeniably excellent. ""Shang-Chi"" was that. It's the perfect balance of humour and action that Marvel have established over the last few years. The action too is tweaked slightly, to more closely resemble the types of Asian led action films that we've seen previously, be that the Jackie Chan style bus fight, or the ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon""-esque flashback fight between Shang Chi's parents. There's some lovely links to the wider MCU, including a return for Benedict Wong's Wong and for Trevor Slattery, Ben Kingsley's ""Iron Man 3"" character whose masquerading role as The Mandarin was one of the MCU's most divisive moments.

It's not perfect. The ending is perhaps a little rushed and lacking a moment or two of redemption earning for Xu Wenwu, but the peaks at the future for the character, and for the 10 Rings organisation is an interesting addition, plus our first real step on what might be the route to the next big bad. Excellent stuff.","For the first time in a couple of years, since 2019's ""Captain Marvel"" the MCU introduces us to a brand new hero.

Much fighting ensues but fortunately everyone eventually learns how to 'get along' when faced with a real threat. You have seen it all before: physics-defying martial arts, monsters who look like the recently swallowed strings of LED Christmas lights, conflicted heroes with wise-cracking 'comic relief' sidekicks (an awful Aquafina and an even more awful Ben Kingsley), giant melees featuring a variety of glowing weapons (but no blood), hyper-kinetic and hyper-implausible car/motorcycle chases, and a lot of clichéd wisecracks, tough-guy dialogue, poseur slo-mo, and heroic vogueing (we're treated to the venerable three-point power landing/slide a number of times). The only novel thing the film has to offer is the excellent rendering of mythological beasts from Chinese culture; otherwise, it's an overly-long (132 minutes, which is 120 minutes too much Aquafina), derivative, repetitive, and ultimately boring entry in the bloated, jejune Micky Mouse-Marvel superhero franchise.","Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) discovers that his all-powerful and millennium-old father is about to launch an attack against the magical village where Shang-Chi's mother was born in the likely mistaken belief that his wife is not dead but is rather being held captive (there is more to the plot than one sentence can sum up but what does it matter... the story is just scaffolding for the special effects).

45,45,Promises good things for MCU's Phase Four,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings stars Simu Liu in the lead role alongside such heavy names as Tony Leung and Michelle Yeoh in this latest installment to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Liu's Shang-Chi must come to his own as the son of the legendary Mandarin (Leung), the owner of the Ten Rings.

I like this film's style most of all. Director Destin Daniel Cretton mixes Chinese wuxia settings and aesthetics with Hong Kong wire kung fu inspired action set pieces, while still keeping it feeling like a Marvel film. There's a surprising amount of callbacks and nods to the larger Marvel universe, pleasing dedicated fans, but the film is still able to stand on its own feet and introduce us to its hero.

Kudos also to the whole filming for these action scenes. Very little shaky cam or jump cuts, especially for the hand to hand scenes. Exactly as it should be. I'd dare to say that this film has some of, if not the best action set pieces in all of MCU.

One of the most thrilling and visually spectacular end battles as well, come to think of it.

Furthermore, the acting is solid, especially from Liu, Leung and Awkwafina, who plays Shang-Chi's American friend. Meng'er Zhang as Xialing, Shang-Chi's younger sister, was perhaps my only real gripe with the film. I could have used either a bit more edge to her or alternatively a lot less. Now she seemed to flipflop between relatable and aggravating.

All in all, not the best Marvel movie by any means, but that's a really high bar to clear. I can simply say that based on this, I'm very optimistic about MCU's continued future.","Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings stars Simu Liu in the lead role alongside such heavy names as Tony Leung and Michelle Yeoh in this latest installment to the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

46,46,The Master of kung fu was really good but not as good as I wanted it to be.,"It was better than the proceeding Marvel movie Black Window. More exceeding the expectations of a Marvel movie. Shang-Chi feels like the marvel movie experience is starting to get back to the normal of the theme ride Martian Scorsese believes they are (I can't disagree, just note that's what I want)

In comparison Shang-Chi is a lower level character. I am a fan of Marvel comics but got more of the references to the Marvel Cinematic Universe in this movie than to the direct comic book references. Those Marvel cinematic universe references were amazing enough to get over the fact that the obvious comic book ones went over my head. I mean this movie's connection to other movies is great fanfare that makes me love it more. So really cool cameos happen that actually move the story along.

I did like what they did with the Mandarin here but do feel they copied and paste a lot of things into the story of Shang-Chi to make a complete movie for a lower level character. From the little I know of the character he more fits into those Netflix's shows they did a few years back but change him enough to justify a blockbuster.

They did succeed in making Shang-Chi's background more fuller. The relationship between him and his father and sister was beautiful, complex and more importantly, never bored me and of course Awkafina as the comedy relief and best friend to Shang-Chi was strategic gold. The story for the background was not that full. It's really a character driven movie for without the amazing performances from a group of actors who know their stuff this story would fall short.

Note, I loved the fact that Michelle Yeoh was in this movie and that gives it a lot, but she's done way better in less effective films (but she most likely got a huge paycheck from Disney just to wave her hands around).

The special effects were good in this flick. I was impress with what was used to make the final conflict and I was convince that the dude from Kim's Convenience was a master of kung fu

Its a good movie but it did not live up to my high expectations of it. It gave me a lot of cool things but really did not give me anything I did not see before, in movies that did it better, but if it's about anything I did spend the rest of the day pretending I knew Kung fu.","It was better than the proceeding Marvel movie Black Window.

48,48,Finally a new kind of marvel story,,
49,49,An easy watch that fits into the MCU well,"A San Francisco valet finds his past catching up with him in spectacular fashion.

This is an entertaining superhero adventure story with an Asian martial arts theme and a number of entertaining scenes.

Like many introductions to superhero characters there is a bit of backstory to go through and this film does it with flashback sequences in a similar way to 'Black Panther'. These are mixed with the action, humour and unfolding narrative of the present day plot. Additionally there is some important exposition added relating to the Marvel multiverse. Personally I think everything depicted could have been done in more than one movie, and not so rushed, but that's just a personal preference. What is presented is not complicated in anyway, but very simplified, presumably so that it can be established quickly and the likes of Shang-Chi and Katy can share screens with other MCU characters as soon as possible.

The tone and general feel of the movie also reminds me of the approach taken with 'Black Panther', particularly when it focusses on a location that, like Wakanda, mixes the sights and sounds of regional culture with the sci-fi fantasy. It has obviously been written carefully so that it displays imagery associated with far-Eastern culture like martial arts, traditional costuming, rural settings, that is marketable to a Western audience, but at the same time it avoids other commonly associated negative stereotyping like exaggerated accents, sorcery, yellow peril, bad driving, and (thankfully) gong sounds. Much of this is drenched with a liberal amount of fast-talking contemporary American humour.

There are a number of highly enjoyable scenes such as the fight sequence on the bus, the various comedy moments, virtually everything that comes out of Ben Kingsley's mouth, and all the flashback scenes. The final dinner table scene is probably my favourite.

Visually as you can imagine it is beautiful and full of top drawer cinematography, editing, and technology-driven effects. For me though the spectacle goes over-the-top, particularly in the final action sequence.

Most actors are solid such as Simu Liu, Tony Leung, Meng'er Zhang, Michelle Yeoh, Fala Chen, and Benedict Wong. The standout performances for me easily are Nora Lum and Ben Kingsley who have buckets of charisma and the advantage of all the best lines.

Overall there is little to criticise, it just feels like what Martin Scorsese described perfectly in 2019 as a theme park rather than cinema.","A San Francisco valet finds his past catching up with him in spectacular fashion.

This is an entertaining superhero adventure story with an Asian martial arts theme and a number of entertaining scenes.

Like many introductions to superhero characters there is a bit of backstory to go through and this film does it with flashback sequences in a similar way to 'Black Panther'. These are mixed with the action, humour and unfolding narrative of the present day plot. Additionally there is some important exposition added relating to the Marvel multiverse. Personally I think everything depicted could have been done in more than one movie, and not so rushed, but that's just a personal preference.

Fast paced, energetic, and relentless, not particularly the genre I normally go to, or enjoy, but I loved every second of it, a visual masterpiece. Superb acting, terrific musics, but it's produced in such a magical way, it is stunning.

54,54,Precious ... ten times,"Of course I am just riffing off, teasing and making fun of certain things with my summary line. Though there is some truth in there too - especially if you consider the last third of the movie - quite fantastical, pun intended.

But there is so much more here. And while you may have seen the bus scene already (I imagine many times), it still is quite the highlight and works wonders! Because there is even more to it than the trailer/teaser revealed! As is with the plot and the characters of the movie.

I was able to watch it on an Imax screen and let me tell you ... wow! But also wow and much respect to Marvel and Feige and anyone involved that they dared to make the first ten minutes or so in chinese! And throwing a lot of chinese terms (slang?) in there as well - throughout! That gives it a touch of authenticity. How immigrants in America or anywhere else in the world grew up. I do the same with my Greek and German/English.

It is also nice and while I am prone to be sarcastic, I really think it's a good thing to have such a major and big representation - especially nowadays with Anti-Asian hate/crime rising. All because of people blaming China and people of China for a virus ... the movie does not have that as a topic, it is entertainment after all, but in every promo and interview that the actors were involved it was something that was mentioned. Good for them and good for us, that this was made.

I am a bit biased when it comes to the MCU and this did get a pure theatrical release, instead of the Black Widow treatment (which also was available on Disney plus and the cinemas at the same time). So there is not issue when it comes to that. And if you can watch it on the big screen - you will not be dissapointed! Now waiting for the other stuff to drop ... especially after the mid credit scene, that is such a tease ... the after the credits scene might also hint at something, but the bigger tease was midway through the credits (actually almost at the beginning of them to be honest).

Sit back and enhoy the movie and the really funny characters ... and quite a few familiar faces. Some from the MCU and previous entries but also some from Asian cinema!

56,56,Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,,
57,57,The best Marvel movie so far...,"Having seen the trailer for the 2021 Marvel action movie ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" I must admit that of course I was going to watch it, but I feared it would just be another run-of-the-mill-over-the-top-CGI-fest-but-barred-of-proper-contents Marvel movie. Yet, I opted to sit down and watch it, on the notion that it was a Marvel movie. But also because of the cast that starred in it.

And yeah, this movie was over the top in terms of CGI. Of course it was, because it is a Marvel movie after all. But luckily this movie broke the formula of the archetypical Marvel movie and this actually turned out to be the best Marvel movie so far. Well, at least in my opinion. Why? Well, because of the storyline and the fact that it mixed Asian culture and lore into the Marvel cinematic universe, and it was a much needed addition to an otherwise Western-focused series of movies.

The storyline told in ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"", as written by Dave Callaham, Destin Daniel Cretton and Andrew Lanham was certainly entertaining. And the movie didn't really have a dull moment, despite the fact that it was a movie that ran for 132 minutes. I thoroughly enjoyed the entire movie from beginning to end. And for me, this was a storyline with proper contents to it, that also included interesting characters and creatures.

Visually then ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" blew me away. The CGI team really worked their magic with this movie and brought it to life in a very visually fulfilling way. Lots of nice details and jaw-dropping special effects. And the creature designs in the movie were off the charts, I really enjoyed seeing those brought to life on the screen.

The character gallery in ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" was interesting, and that applies for both the villain and good guy side.

And they had such a great cast ensemble put together for ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"", with the likes of Asian cinema heavy weighters such as Tony Chiu-Wai Leung, Michelle Yeoh and Wah Yuen. But the movie was also nicely carried by Simu Liu, whom I was not familiar with prior to this movie. And also having Awkwafina in the movie was just brilliant, because she put on a spot on performance with her comedy sidekick character. And it was interesting and nice to see Ben Kingsley return to reprise his character of Trevor Slattery.

""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" is a good combination of action and narrative storytelling, which made for a very wholesome movie. And it should be said that the action sequences were breathtaking to behold, so very, very nicely choreographed and executed on the screen, taking that traditional Wuxia elements seen in Asian movies and mixing it in with the archetypical Marvel Western-based superhero movies.

I was more than genuinely entertained by ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" and it is certainly a movie that bolsters Marvel's hold for me, as their movies tend to be super flashy with spectacular effects, but rather hollow in terms of proper entertainment and storytelling.

My rating of ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" lands on a well-deserved nine out of ten stars.

59,59,Ten Years too Late,,
60,60,Indeed legendary,"It's been ten years since Shang-Chi(Liu, charming, stoic) last saw his father, and leader of the criminal empire The Ten Rings, Wenwu(Leung, charismatic enough that we feel a lot of empathy for him, even when he does terrible things that we desperately want him to stop doing). That was also when he last spent time with his sister, Xialing(Zhang, a badass who deserves more screen time. Honestly, I'd be very surprised if she didn't, in future projects). He's joined by his friend Katy(Awkwafina, quirky, providing a lot of comic relief, something I'm told she's in general adept at), for what can best be described as a tense reunion, which allows the movie to really mine the family melodrama, one of the best elements it has. I won't give away exactly what the antagonist intends to do, only that our hero has to stop him. However, he has to figure out how, maybe even if, that is even possible.

Not quite, yet almost ""Black Panther for Asian audiences"", this does a lot for representation(including for women. Some of the best characters in this are female. In addition to the two that I've already mentioned, there is also Ying Nan(Yeoh, wise)), it is positively drenched in Chinese culture(the third act, while in ways it feels like it belongs to a completely different film than the first two, takes an especially deep dive into that. Ultimately, it is presented through a Western lens, and clearly we need to go further in this direction, still, it is a big deal that they put so much of it in an estimated $150 to 200 million major blockbuster, which will be seen by millions of people who would never consider watching an art picture, especially one focusing on a group they don't belong to), to the point where countless times, when it makes sense, major characters in this speak Mandarin to each other, rather than English, which it is subtitled into. And ""don't worry"", for those who think that the following is important: there are white people on screen, and they aren't made out to be ""less than"".

The action(each sequence of which feels distinct, belongs with the rest, and is memorable) pays tribute to many different kinds of martial arts films, acknowledging that they are standing on the shoulders of giants. Jackie Chan, wuxia, etc. The choreography is matched in skill by the cinematography. Not only are we seeing incredible fighting, the camera is dynamic, celebrating and highlighting how incredible it is. That *is* why you hire Bill Pope, the director of photography on the Matrix trilogy, two of Sam Raimi's Spider-Man entries, Darkman and Team America. The special effects are excellent. There are some issues with pacing, and certainly a chunk of this is composed almost entirely of flashbacks.

This features relatively brief but highly concentrated, surprisingly graphic gore(you know, there was a time when the fact that it's happening to beings that clearly are not human, wasn't enough to get away with this kind of thing with a PG-13 rating. Pepperidge Farm remembers), as well as a little strong language. I recommend this to any fan of comic book movie adaptations, and people passionate about diversity hiring. 8/10.","It's been ten years since Shang-Chi(Liu, charming, stoic) last saw his father, and leader of the criminal empire The Ten Rings, Wenwu(Leung, charismatic enough that we feel a lot of empathy for him, even when he does terrible things that we desperately want him to stop doing).

Some might find it over the top but it's a Marvel so what do you expect? To me this is one of Marvels best movies yet if not the best. The acting was good as well, and that from the whole cast. I never heard of Shang-Chi before but from now he has one more fan. Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings won't disappoint a lot of people, unless you're just not into this genre of movies.

65,65,A Marvel for the whole family.,"""The US government was almost toppled by a pretender named after an orange."" Wenwu (Tony Leung)

This quote is typical of the light-hearted but also serious addition to the MCU that is Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings. Although Marvel has always been less serious than DC, this time it leaves Superman and Batman to cry in their capes. Sweet superhero Sean/Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) has more humanity than almost any other hero, and he uses his martial arts only when pressed.

The opening sequence on a bus (you can see the bad coming from other cinematic bus rides such as in Nobody) is rousing and entertaining. It has a fight sequence I laughed through because of its ballet-like composition but satisfying because it sets up character and motivation.

When things get heavy, and they do because Sean must confront and potentially kill his 1000-year-old mobster dad, Wenwu, Awkwafina's Katy, Sean's girlfriend, is there with amusing one-liners throughout the adventure, right down to a life-saving shot in the big ending battle scene.

Director Destin Daniel Cretton deftly orchestrates his fights and his characters' lines with the authority of a much more seasoned filmmaker. He never loses sight of the central motif-the affirmation of family primacy, so that the potential chaos of a giant cast and multiple plot strands hosts a unity glued by character and dialogue.

67,67,The legend of the ten Marvel movies a year for all eternity.,"'Shang-Chi And The Legend Of The Ten Rings (2021)' is, essentially, exactly what you expect it to be. Not only does it feel like a Marvel movie, it feels like a literal Disney movie as well. This is often detrimental to the overall affair, as the piece should have been much more unique than it ultimately is, and it makes for a much less interesting watch overall. However, the formula it follows has provided plenty of success in the past; this time is no exception. Its highs are where you'd expect them to be, as are its lows, and there is an undeniable sense of fun, albeit cookie-cutter fun, to be had. The film is an entertaining action adventure that follows a young man whose criminal father calls him and his sister back home in order to lay siege to the mystical village he believes is holding his wife, the protagonist's mother, hostage. The villain's motivation is a little underexplored yet entirely understandable. It comes from a believable emotional place and is more satisfying because of it. The relationship between the lead and his no-good dad isn't explored as much as it could be, though, and the flick generally has a bit of a theming issue. The piece tries to tie its events directly into the wants and needs of its lead characters, but it does so in an unsatisfyingly half-baked way and honestly would probably have been better if it played itself as more of a straightforward adventure ala most of the 'Mission: Impossible (1996-)' series. Still, the touches of character development are appreciated and each lead player is written to be as likeable as possible. This, combined with the amicable performances, means that you care about the heroes even though you don't have all that much reason to. This keeps you invested in their stories throughout. The highlight of the entire affair is, for sure, its action. For the most part, the picture stays towards the right end of the practical to CG spectrum. The fights are never exactly realistic, per se, but they're based on competent choreography and clean camerawork. They're, more often than not, really entertaining. Sadly, the flick inches closer and closer towards the wrong end of the aforementioned spectrum the longer it goes on. By the time it reaches its finale (which gives me major 'Fast And Furious Presents Hobbs And Shaw (2019)' vibes for some reason), it's clear that the balance it previously achieved is going to go out of the window. Sure enough, its climactic battle is an entirely computer-generated affair; it isn't all that compelling and goes directly against what made the movie so enjoyable to begin with. No matter how hard it tries to disguise it, it still ends with a big blue beam in the sky. Still, the finale isn't exactly bad. It's just annoyingly intangible and feels a little forced in, even (as do the rather cringe-worthy post-credits scenes). Ultimately, this is a generic yet entertaining experience. Its charming acting and exciting action are clearly its highlights, and its weakest aspects are still decent enough. It's a good movie. However, I can't deny that Marvel fatigue is becoming more and more pertinent in my mind. You know what you're going to get before you get it. Plus, the studio's insistence that it has to perforate every single outing with references to other, almost entirely irrelevant fare is really annoying. Although most of their movies are at least okay, I find myself not caring at all about them. That's sad, really, considering that the MCU has produced some genuinely great pictures in the past. 7/10.","'Shang-Chi And The Legend Of The Ten Rings (2021)' is, essentially, exactly what you expect it to be. Not only does it feel like a Marvel movie, it feels like a literal Disney movie as well. This is often detrimental to the overall affair, as the piece should have been much more unique than it ultimately is, and it makes for a much less interesting watch overall. However, the formula it follows has provided plenty of success in the past; this time is no exception. Its highs are where you'd expect them to be, as are its lows, and there is an undeniable sense of fun, albeit cookie-cutter fun, to be had. The film is an entertaining action adventure that follows a young man whose criminal father calls him and his sister back home in order to lay siege to the mystical village he believes is holding his wife, the protagonist's mother, hostage. The villain's motivation is a little underexplored yet entirely understandable. It comes from a believable emotional place and is more satisfying because of it. The relationship between the lead and his no-good dad isn't explored as much as it could be, though, and the flick generally has a bit of a theming issue. The piece tries to tie its events directly into the wants and needs of its lead characters, but it does so in an unsatisfyingly half-baked way and honestly would probably have been better if it played itself as more of a straightforward adventure ala most of the 'Mission: Impossible (1996-)' series. Still, the touches of character development are appreciated and each lead player is written to be as likeable as possible.

68,68,Fun martial arts action-comedy with some dragon ex machina,"After a flashback, this movie jumps to a couple of slackers, Shaun and Katy, with Shaun proving during a wild bus ride that he is much more than a car attendant. Soon they're on a globe hoping adventure with world-saving dimensions.

The martial arts choreography is terrific, from the opening forest fight through that fantastic bus bit to the final hand-to-hand battle (followed by the big special effects battle seemingly required in every Marvel film). Fights are funny and exciting and that final battle is truly suspenseful.

The cast is also excellent. Awkwafina is as funny as ever, Michelle Yeoh and Tony Leung bring all their seasoned expertise to their roles, and the actors are don't know are also first rate.

Although ... in the case of Simu Liu, who plays Shaun/Shang-Chi, I have no strong opinion. He's a pleasant every man who handles the action scenes well but seems less mythic hero than ""genial best friend of the main character."" With all the other talent on screen he doesn't manage to leave much of an impression, but on the bright side I don't object to him.

The story is fun, the movie does a good job of mixing humor, action, and tragical reminiscences the pace is terrific, and man there are some great fights. Recommended.","After a flashback, this movie jumps to a couple of slackers, Shaun and Katy, with Shaun proving during a wild bus ride that he is much more than a car attendant.

69,69,my eyes couldn't handle the sheer awesomeness on the screen,"Watch this in IMAX!!!! The entire movie has an expanded aspect ratio. You're watching about 70% of the image on normal screens, plus on way smaller screens with worse speakers. I promise, it's worth it

WOWOWOWOWOW. This movie blew me away. I love it. A LOT. From beginning to end. Everything. I walked out of the movie so hyped, silent-screaming under my mask as i walked to the car. It's been a while since i walked out of a movie this happy. I have so much to say.

I love the MCU (a lot), but there are a few things that are frequently lacking. One of them is good fight scenes. They always have awesome action scenes, but specifically fight scenes are usually pretty good, only great in a few movies like civil war and winter soldier. And in general, fight scenes in American movies pale in comparison to Asian cinema (Ip man, The Raid Redemption, anything Jackie Chan).

The fight scenes in this movie.... how do i describe it... amazing martial arts that's fast but clear, filmed in creative and astonishing ways without a hint of shaky cam or quick cuts, against stunningly beautiful backdrops... phenomenal. And they continuously focus on the fights instead of cutting to a different scene after 10 seconds like i've noticed in the MCU.

This is BY FAR the best fighting in the MCU and it's not even close. Has to be up there with the John Wick series and Netflix's Daredevil as some of the best we've seen in America lately. I loved the first major fight scene so much that i was worried it would be the best one of the movie, far too early. Lol. I be stupid sometimes

Another frequent flaw in the MCU is lack of compelling villain. Nope. Awesome awesome awesome. That's all i'll say.

Another of my frequent complaints is that the musical scores, with some exceptions, don't stand out. I think they heard. They're on a good streak with the shows and Black Widow. It's not as amazing as the Loki score but i liked it. It felt unique to this new franchise.

Still so much more to say, need to go faster. This is one of the best, maybe THE best, story in the MCU, especially the way it's told. I loved all the characters, i loved all the casting choices, i loved the performances. There are scenes of dialogue that gave me goosebumps. All the emotional moments hit. All the callbacks hit. There isn't anything that didn't work for me. There's no such thing as a perfect movie, but mannnnnn.

Lmao i didn't mention the cinematography. Why would i wait this long? It's MESMERIZING. A lot. Throughout. It's candy for your eyes.

It's also nice to see well-written comedy with jokes relevant to the scene and characters, that feels organic. As opposed to the ""insert joke here"" method we've been seeing more of, especially in Far From Home.

What's the opposite of formulaic? That's this movie. I never knew what to expect next (helps that i didn't watch a single trailer, they ruin movies). Definitely doesn't feel like a typical MCU movie. It has it's own unique tone and feel and character.

Continuing what i said in my headline, i have this thing where i get goosebumps and start tearing up, not from an emotional moment, but from a scene being so incredible, especially action scenes. Don't know why it happens, don't know if it happens to other ppl. Maybe it's partly because i can't risk blinking. That happened in this movie numerous times. Like ""this is the coolest thing i've ever seen in my life."" hyperbole, but mannnnn

after endgame finished phase 3 (yes i know spider-man), i was so happy and satisfied with the MCU. But i wasn't sure they could ever recapture that magic again. I knew i would watch everything and it would probably mostly be awesome. But i wasn't expecting top-tier stuff any more. Lol. I be stupid sometimes. I am ecstatic to have that notion obliterated. As of now, this is a top 6 MCU movie for me. Wow

All in all, i adore this movie. You may wonder why i wouldn't give it a 10 after all this raving. 10s are super rare for me, only 13 of them, and i watch thousands of movies. Interstellar, inception, mad max fury road, etc. Movies that shouldn't even be called movies. My 9s are rare too, they are my favorite movies. 10s are my favorites of my favorites. Only superhero movies i've given 10s are dark knight, dark knight rises and civil war.

If you're still reading, wow you're awesome! I think this is my longest review other than Interstellar.

I'm still in such a good mood. I can't wait to watch it again, in IMAX. I want to wait a week so it feels fresher, but i might not be able to!

Here we go...

I'm not feeling this movie. It starts with promise but It lost me after Wong vs Abomb.

The fighting is exciting. The movie lacks excitement though. It's a plain dull movie.

It's about a Karate master and... yeah the movie lost me and I have know idea what it's about. This is the first mcu film that I lost interest for midway. Even Im3 wasn't so bad because I lost interest from the very beginning.

Gotg2, mcu Spiderman 1/2 and IM3 are still the worse in mcu. Shang Chi just joined the club.

A movie so full of emptiness that it makes an empty box jealous

I'm not sure how this is a 7. Fans and the average movie goer should also be held responsible for horrible movies.

This movie ain't a 7 even if you watched this movie as blind and drunk.

They tried to be funny by having Wong be rude by drinking the couple's drink at the end credit scene. That wasn't funny at all. Wizard or not.

Speaking of funny, I didn't laugh once. When I used to watch these movies in theatres, the audience often told me when I should have laughed. I watched it at home, therefore I didn't know my cue of when to laugh.

The mcu needs to chill with the daddy issue plot

THOR Loki daddy issue Black Panta daddy issues Stark Daddy issues Star lord Daddy issues Ultron daddy issues Nebula and Gamora daddy issues Shang daddy issue Wasp daddy issues Scott langs daughter Daddy issues

84,84,This movie is way better than it should be and is a worthwhile addition to the marvel universe,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (2021) is a movie my wife and I recently watched at the theatre. The storyline for this movie follows a young man and his best friend who work as parking attendants and are one day attacked by super villains. As they dig into the young man's past they discover his father is behind the attack with the purpose of hopefully brining his family back together. This movie is directed by Destin Daniel Cretton (Just Mercy) and stars Simu Liu (Blood and Water), Tony Chiu-Wai Leung (Infernal Affairs), Ben Kingsley (Iron Man 3), Michelle Yeoh (Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon) and Awkwafina (Crazy Rich Asians). The storyline for this movie is way better than it should be and has crazy depth around all of the characters. You really understand the what, when and why behind every circumstance and perspective. The acting is outstanding and the characters are perfectly portrayed. The special effects are awesome both in terms of the action scenes and backdrops. The dragons may have been a bit overdone; but other than that, A++++. The choreography was also excellent and seeing Yeoh in this really made me smile. This movie is way better than it should be and is a worthwhile addition to the marvel universe. I'd strongly recommend it. I'd score this a solid 8/10.","Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (2021) is a movie my wife and I recently watched at the theatre.

86,86,"Epic, stunning, and a strong powerhouse story.","5 out of 5 stars.

Shang-Chi and the legend of the Ten Rings is an awesome and exciting mcu film that brings the stunning world with the asian culture. I will say i enjoyed this more than the previous mcu film Black Widow. Shang Chi introduces a new mcu character played by Simu Liu. And Awkwafina which is also a fun addition. While they are being chased by an organization called ten rings. Lead by his father Tony Leung. While Shang Chi learns his abilities and the ten rings. Before his father is trying to use that power for a personal reason.

Great epic plot. Shang Chi and Katy (Awkwafina) enter a hidden world Ta Lao where there is magical mythical creatures. Is like a wow stunning moment when you first see Wakanda in Black Panther. The film does give an emotional story build up and a villain that can be relatable.

The cast ensemble is great. Simu Liu did great with the character along with Awkwafina as his friend. Meng'er Zhang, Michelle Yeoh, Benedict Wong, Florian Munteanu, and Tong Leung all did great.

The set designs and visual effects are stunning and great. Can be colorful at moments. The music score was good as well. The action sequences are great and exciting. Every set piece had an awesome martial arts choreography which was well shot with the cinematography. Director did a great job in capturing the action and fight sequences. Even with the epic climax of the dragon battle.

There are two mid and post credit scene which sets up for further films and has a fun nod to the mcu.

I will say Shang Chi is a great exciting addition and i found the film to be very fast moving. Action packed. And a great family conflict story that is emotionally driven.","5 out of 5 stars.

87,87,A Marvel-ous martial arts joy,"Showing no signs of slowing down hot off the heels of Black Widow, a raft of well-received Disney+ series and arriving not too far in front of the hotly anticipated The Eternals, Marvel continues to put in work that puts many other wheelhouses too shame, with the marital arts infused Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, yet another entry into the brands increasingly loaded catalogue of quality blockbuster releases.

It's hard to pinpoint exactly what Marvel keep doing to maintain the momentum that started all those years ago with 2008's Iron Man, it's absolutely correct when many say a lot of these origin stories and event pictures follow a very set formula from A to B, but with an ability to attract some of the best actors working in the industry today and handpicking a raft of some of the most exciting Hollywood filmmakers around, Marvel have once more struck gold with the incredibly fun and inventive Shang-Chi.

Quite possibly the most visually sumptuous Marvel film yet, sometimes feeling as if Marvel has meet with Ang Lee/Yimou Zhang and in my mind the Marvel film that features the best choregraphed action scenes yet from the spectacle heavy brand, Shang-Chi is a big screen blast that is freshly directed by the upcoming Destin Daniel Cretton who here has got his just rewards after his great debut Short Term 12 and the sadly undervalued The Glass Castle came before this big-budgeted ride.

Infusing his film with a great energy and charm that is enhanced by the work of leads Simu Liu (in a career launching turn) as our likable hero Shaun/Shang-Chi, Awkwafina (doing her usual but fun schtick) as Shaun's bestie Katy and Tony Leung as the unfortunate villain of the piece Xu Wenwu, Cretton has turned out to be the perfect choice to start off the cinematic journey of the fist swinging Shang-Chi and helps instill in his film some nice differences to what we've come to expect from comic book blockbusters of the modern era.

Most notably for the film is the exciting use of hand to hand combat that is delivered spectacularly in two stand out sequences on board a moving bus and then bettered alongside a high rise building in Macau, both these set pieces are easily some of the most noteworthy of any Marvel film yet while also benefiting the film other than its Asian infused eccentricities is the fun relationship between Shang-Chi and Katy than never bothers with adding extra baggage to add weight to their believable and fun friendship.

If there was a major drawback to Shang-Chi's many wins it is in an overdrawn finale, a major problem many have acknowledged previously when it comes to Marvel films, Cretton and his team can't quite stick the landing for Shang-Chi with it being a little too long in the tooth for its own good and slightly overblown and while it features some incredible imagery and technical wizardry, the films rip-roaring start and strong middle section gives way too something lesser.

Final Say -

Another huge win for Marvel who have here with the help of director Destin Daniel Cretton and his talented cast, created an instantly likable cinematic universe that provides the comic kings with one of their most unique and exciting playgrounds yet.

88,88,Not bad,"The opening fight scene is worth the watch, but the cameos steal the show. I won't go in to detail. The Marvel geeks will know what I mean, because there are plenty to count even the hidden ones.

The movie is good and I like the casting. The direction is okay but the cinematography is the best.

The ending is anti climatic. I found it to be cliche. However it is worth the watch. It is nice to see a movie like this and I believe it is a good addition to your watch list.","The opening fight scene is worth the watch, but the cameos steal the show. I won't go in to detail.

89,89,Yet another superb stand-alone superhero flick in MCEU's kitty.,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (2021) : Brief Review -

Yet another superb stand-alone superhero flick in MCEU's kitty. MCEU's new phase never looked so promising but their products are delivering Better than expected. That Spider Man flick in 2019, right after Endgame, changed many perceptions about Marvel's future and even though couple of their recent series like 'Wanda Vision' and 'Loki' couldn't emerge as clear winners, they have set a solid base for upcoming new stories. Shang-Chi is a new start by all means. Not only because it comes under new phase but mainly because it is a stand-alone film and with a new superhero who is more like using traditional combat methods along with ancient superpowers. When Captain America or Black Panther begun as Stand-alone films, they promised too much and thankfully fulfilled it. Shang-Chi does the same. It may not promise too much like Steve Rogers and Wakanda stories but the point where it ends surely gives us hints of new assembled version of superheroes in Multiverse. Shang-Chi, the master of unarmed weaponry-based Kung Fu, is forced to confront his past after being drawn into the Ten Rings organization. The film has major portion covered by Family values and hence, it may look predictable but does not bore at all. Yes, few scenes are outdated and too dramatic as if we are watching a Superhero Film made in 90s but let's just forget those weak points as Shang Chi has excelled in Visual spectacle. The screenplay could have been better in the second half when the big War was supposed to take place but it actually looks tiny one except for those two humongous dragons which might remind you of 'The Hobbit'. Performances by Simu Li, Awkwafina, Meng'er Zhang, Fala Chen, Florian Munteanu are fine according to less potential available for the roles. Actually, the humour and tone of these characters was great. They all looked normal people when they were not fighting and even though the film has ancient refrences, the character don't actually go too deep to become expressive. Director Destin Daniel Cretton seemed slightly off track in the beginning when he tries to humanise all the characters with that typically teenage humor but as the film goes ahead, he recovers from the childish entanglement. With super explosive climax he surely makes up for his mistakes, rather makes us forgive it. Overall, Shang Chi is another superb entertainer for Marvel Fanboys and even neutrals are gonna enjoy it.

RATING - 7/10*

90,90,This could've been great if it wasn't for the cheesy writing.,"The story was riddled with holes and plot issues. Since when does Awkwafina's pedestrian character all of a sudden get invited to become part of the MCU team? What's her super power... stupidity? Don't get me wrong, I love her, but her character was lazily written. Then there's the whole daddy issues dynamic - Shang is with him, then against, then with etc.. Then we have these ridiculous dragons fighting, where one scores some power crystals and becomes stronger! This is just infantile lazy writing. There was zero shock value or anything spectacular in the entire runtime, with tedious long middle acts and a bumbling third act. The jokes were cliched and not funny. The funniest parts were Ben Kingsley's character, (of whom was in this for what reasons??) and the ending to go Karaoke - which was the only time I actually cracked a chuckle. You'd think with three writers we'd have something cohesive and coherent. But instead of a Marvel superhero story, we got a Disney evil vs good with dragons thrown into the mix. It's as if they tried too hard to create the Asian version of Black Panther.

It's a shame, because the directing and cinematography were spot on, and great S/VFX - although a little overboard with the CGI i.e. Dragons. The martial arts choreography was outstanding (although again, overboard after the awesome bus scene), and the casting and performances were excellent, especially Leung, who pretty much carried the film on his shoulders. It's a 7/10 from me.","The story was riddled with holes and plot issues. Since when does Awkwafina's pedestrian character all of a sudden get invited to become part of the MCU team?

91,91,8 Rings out of 10,"For the first time in a couple of years, since 2019's ""Captain Marvel"" the MCU introduces us to a brand new hero. Simu Liu who, rather impressively, first asked for the role on Twitter brings us Shang-Chi in a film that perhaps does have some issues with it's ending, but ultimately is a fun, funny ride of the type Marvel have been perfecting for the last 13 years.

Talented, but somewhat aimless, Shaun (Simu Liu) lives in San Francisco working as a valet with his friend Katy (Awkwafina). When he's attacked on a bus, he's forced back into the world of his father, a ruthless terrorist Xu Wenwu (Tony Chiu-Wai Leung). First visiting his sister, then returning to the Ten Rings compound, Shang-Chi decides to use his skills to defend his late mothers sacred homeland against invasion from his father and for control of ten mystical arm rings, weapons that grant their owner immortality and unearthly power.

If ""Black Widow"" was considered a wobble for the MCU, despite the fact I thought that it's a perfectly fine film, then it was important to come back with something that was undeniably excellent. ""Shang-Chi"" was that. It's the perfect balance of humour and action that Marvel have established over the last few years. The action too is tweaked slightly, to more closely resemble the types of Asian led action films that we've seen previously, be that the Jackie Chan style bus fight, or the ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon""-esque flashback fight between Shang Chi's parents. There's some lovely links to the wider MCU, including a return for Benedict Wong's Wong and for Trevor Slattery, Ben Kingsley's ""Iron Man 3"" character whose masquerading role as The Mandarin was one of the MCU's most divisive moments.

It's not perfect. The ending is perhaps a little rushed and lacking a moment or two of redemption earning for Xu Wenwu, but the peaks at the future for the character, and for the 10 Rings organisation is an interesting addition, plus our first real step on what might be the route to the next big bad. Excellent stuff.","For the first time in a couple of years, since 2019's ""Captain Marvel"" the MCU introduces us to a brand new hero.

Much fighting ensues but fortunately everyone eventually learns how to 'get along' when faced with a real threat. You have seen it all before: physics-defying martial arts, monsters who look like the recently swallowed strings of LED Christmas lights, conflicted heroes with wise-cracking 'comic relief' sidekicks (an awful Aquafina and an even more awful Ben Kingsley), giant melees featuring a variety of glowing weapons (but no blood), hyper-kinetic and hyper-implausible car/motorcycle chases, and a lot of clichéd wisecracks, tough-guy dialogue, poseur slo-mo, and heroic vogueing (we're treated to the venerable three-point power landing/slide a number of times). The only novel thing the film has to offer is the excellent rendering of mythological beasts from Chinese culture; otherwise, it's an overly-long (132 minutes, which is 120 minutes too much Aquafina), derivative, repetitive, and ultimately boring entry in the bloated, jejune Micky Mouse-Marvel superhero franchise.","Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) discovers that his all-powerful and millennium-old father is about to launch an attack against the magical village where Shang-Chi's mother was born in the likely mistaken belief that his wife is not dead but is rather being held captive (there is more to the plot than one sentence can sum up but what does it matter... the story is just scaffolding for the special effects).

95,95,Promises good things for MCU's Phase Four,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings stars Simu Liu in the lead role alongside such heavy names as Tony Leung and Michelle Yeoh in this latest installment to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Liu's Shang-Chi must come to his own as the son of the legendary Mandarin (Leung), the owner of the Ten Rings.

I like this film's style most of all. Director Destin Daniel Cretton mixes Chinese wuxia settings and aesthetics with Hong Kong wire kung fu inspired action set pieces, while still keeping it feeling like a Marvel film. There's a surprising amount of callbacks and nods to the larger Marvel universe, pleasing dedicated fans, but the film is still able to stand on its own feet and introduce us to its hero.

Kudos also to the whole filming for these action scenes. Very little shaky cam or jump cuts, especially for the hand to hand scenes. Exactly as it should be. I'd dare to say that this film has some of, if not the best action set pieces in all of MCU.

One of the most thrilling and visually spectacular end battles as well, come to think of it.

Furthermore, the acting is solid, especially from Liu, Leung and Awkwafina, who plays Shang-Chi's American friend. Meng'er Zhang as Xialing, Shang-Chi's younger sister, was perhaps my only real gripe with the film. I could have used either a bit more edge to her or alternatively a lot less. Now she seemed to flipflop between relatable and aggravating.

All in all, not the best Marvel movie by any means, but that's a really high bar to clear. I can simply say that based on this, I'm very optimistic about MCU's continued future.","Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings stars Simu Liu in the lead role alongside such heavy names as Tony Leung and Michelle Yeoh in this latest installment to the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

96,96,The Master of kung fu was really good but not as good as I wanted it to be.,"It was better than the proceeding Marvel movie Black Window. More exceeding the expectations of a Marvel movie. Shang-Chi feels like the marvel movie experience is starting to get back to the normal of the theme ride Martian Scorsese believes they are (I can't disagree, just note that's what I want)

In comparison Shang-Chi is a lower level character. I am a fan of Marvel comics but got more of the references to the Marvel Cinematic Universe in this movie than to the direct comic book references. Those Marvel cinematic universe references were amazing enough to get over the fact that the obvious comic book ones went over my head. I mean this movie's connection to other movies is great fanfare that makes me love it more. So really cool cameos happen that actually move the story along.

I did like what they did with the Mandarin here but do feel they copied and paste a lot of things into the story of Shang-Chi to make a complete movie for a lower level character. From the little I know of the character he more fits into those Netflix's shows they did a few years back but change him enough to justify a blockbuster.

They did succeed in making Shang-Chi's background more fuller. The relationship between him and his father and sister was beautiful, complex and more importantly, never bored me and of course Awkafina as the comedy relief and best friend to Shang-Chi was strategic gold. The story for the background was not that full. It's really a character driven movie for without the amazing performances from a group of actors who know their stuff this story would fall short.

Note, I loved the fact that Michelle Yeoh was in this movie and that gives it a lot, but she's done way better in less effective films (but she most likely got a huge paycheck from Disney just to wave her hands around).

The special effects were good in this flick. I was impress with what was used to make the final conflict and I was convince that the dude from Kim's Convenience was a master of kung fu

Its a good movie but it did not live up to my high expectations of it. It gave me a lot of cool things but really did not give me anything I did not see before, in movies that did it better, but if it's about anything I did spend the rest of the day pretending I knew Kung fu.","It was better than the proceeding Marvel movie Black Window.

Those Marvel cinematic universe references were amazing enough to get over the fact that the obvious comic book ones went over my head. I mean this movie's connection to other movies is great fanfare that makes me love it more. So really cool cameos happen that actually move the story along.

I did like what they did with the Mandarin here but do feel they copied and paste a lot of things into the story of Shang-Chi to make a complete movie for a lower level character. From the little I know of the character he more fits into those Netflix's shows they did a few years back but change him enough to justify a blockbuster.

They did succeed in making Shang-Chi's background more fuller. The relationship between him and his father and sister was beautiful, complex and more importantly, never bored me and of course Awkafina as the comedy relief and best friend to Shang-Chi was strategic gold. The story for the background was not that full. It's really a character driven movie for without the amazing performances from a group of actors who know their stuff this story would fall short.

Note, I loved the fact that Michelle Yeoh was in this movie and that gives it a lot, but she's done way better in less effective films (but she most likely got a huge paycheck from Disney just to wave her hands around).

The special effects were good in this flick. I was impress with what was used to make the final conflict and I was convince that the dude from Kim's Convenience was a master of kung fu

Its a good movie but it did not live up to my high expectations of it. It gave me a lot of cool things but really did not give me anything I did not see before, in movies that did it better, but if it's about anything I did spend the rest of the day pretending I knew Kung fu."

98,98,Finally a new kind of marvel story,,
99,99,An easy watch that fits into the MCU well,"A San Francisco valet finds his past catching up with him in spectacular fashion.

This is an entertaining superhero adventure story with an Asian martial arts theme and a number of entertaining scenes.

Like many introductions to superhero characters there is a bit of backstory to go through and this film does it with flashback sequences in a similar way to 'Black Panther'. These are mixed with the action, humour and unfolding narrative of the present day plot. Additionally there is some important exposition added relating to the Marvel multiverse. Personally I think everything depicted could have been done in more than one movie, and not so rushed, but that's just a personal preference. What is presented is not complicated in anyway, but very simplified, presumably so that it can be established quickly and the likes of Shang-Chi and Katy can share screens with other MCU characters as soon as possible.

The tone and general feel of the movie also reminds me of the approach taken with 'Black Panther', particularly when it focusses on a location that, like Wakanda, mixes the sights and sounds of regional culture with the sci-fi fantasy. It has obviously been written carefully so that it displays imagery associated with far-Eastern culture like martial arts, traditional costuming, rural settings, that is marketable to a Western audience, but at the same time it avoids other commonly associated negative stereotyping like exaggerated accents, sorcery, yellow peril, bad driving, and (thankfully) gong sounds. Much of this is drenched with a liberal amount of fast-talking contemporary American humour.

There are a number of highly enjoyable scenes such as the fight sequence on the bus, the various comedy moments, virtually everything that comes out of Ben Kingsley's mouth, and all the flashback scenes. The final dinner table scene is probably my favourite.

Visually as you can imagine it is beautiful and full of top drawer cinematography, editing, and technology-driven effects. For me though the spectacle goes over-the-top, particularly in the final action sequence.

Most actors are solid such as Simu Liu, Tony Leung, Meng'er Zhang, Michelle Yeoh, Fala Chen, and Benedict Wong. The standout performances for me easily are Nora Lum and Ben Kingsley who have buckets of charisma and the advantage of all the best lines.

Overall there is little to criticise, it just feels like what Martin Scorsese described perfectly in 2019 as a theme park rather than cinema.","A San Francisco valet finds his past catching up with him in spectacular fashion.

105,105,Marvel Sprinkles a Different Flavor into the MCU,"Marvel gets mystical in this mashup of the plucky, familiar MCU character and the more stoic, legend-heavy air of wuxia films. It's a fresh mix, effectively breaking the gravity of its more serious moments with a well-timed jape while lending credence and lore to a lesser-known corner of the comic kingdom, but these crossover moments sometimes test their limits. I could see more grounded viewers being turned off by the dragons and soul-sucking demons (far cry from the feasible reality of the first Iron Man, that) while serious fans of Chinese fantasy are bucked by the constant injection of loose wit and slappy one-liners.

When it's rolling, Shang Chi does manage to toe that line and deliver something appropriately new and versatile, a good reflection of both worlds. It benefits from a tight pair of central performances (Simu Liu and Awkwafina as a team of underachieving twenty-somethings) and several big, powerful action sets (the articulated bus fight might be one of the best combat scenes Marvel's ever put out) while tying in a dangling thread or two from earlier films to provide a sense of greater connection. On several occasions, however, it's guilty of being too self-indulgent and losing the narrative. It's great to see Ben Kingsley again, adding nuance to his part in Iron Man 3, but his scenes are the main offender here; excessive and distracting and way too cute.

The action is strong, the dialogue (mostly) works, the scenery looks great, but in the big picture, Shang Chi feels small-scale and disposable. Non-completionists won't miss anything crucial if they choose to skip it.","Marvel gets mystical in this mashup of the plucky, familiar MCU character and the more stoic, legend-heavy air of wuxia films.

108,108,Marvel movie by the numbers with beautiful dragons and charming locations,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is yet another movie inspired by the Marvel universe that has constantly been inspiring the cinematic world for more than a decade now. While the movie follows the usual stereotypes, it manages to stand out with its stunning special effects and locations.

The movie revolves around Shaun, a Chinese immigrant living in the United States of America who is working as a valet with his quirky friend and soulmate Katy. One day, they get attacked by a group of assassins on a bus and only just manage to survive. Shaun immediately understands that the attack must be related to his influential estranged father. Along with Katy, he decides to team up with his tough estranged sister Xialing to find out what's going on.

This film convinces on multiple levels. First of all, the acting performances are quite quirky and convincing. Especially the ladies steal the show. Awkwafina delivers the goods as curious, dynamic and funny woman that anyone would like to have as a friend. Zhang Meng'er on the other side represents a much darker character shaped by dramatic events from the past who is much more difficult to approach with her tough, relentless and independent personality.

The expensive special effects certainly deliver the goods as well. The scenes in a fantasy world, in Ancient China and in contemporary San Francisco are all equally stunning to watch. The fantastic creatures such as dragons look impressive on the big screen.

The story might be predictable but is nevertheless entertaining from start to finish thanks to steady pace and inspired execution. You will truly care about the fates of the different characters as you are watching this film.

However, this film isn't without its occasional flaws. First of all, lead actor Simu Liu simply doesn't have the charisma of the other actresses and actors involved. Casting him was a bold choice but it didn't fully pay off in my opinion.

Up next, the movie desperately tries to connect to other characters in the Marvel Universe. The appearance of Trevor Slattery played by Ben Kingsley is completely random as it only seems to be a pretext to offer some misplaced comic relief. The mid-credit scene starts in an amusing fashion but suddenly involving Bruce Banner and Carol Danvers only seems like a weak attempt to develop a hype for potential sequels. The same goes for yet another scene after the credits that evokes more questions rather than concluding the film appropriately.

At the end of the day, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is an entertaining fantasy action film of the Marvel Universe that should appeal to faithful and occasional fans alike. It's one of the better films in the franchise but perhaps Marvel should focus on quality over quantity instead of becoming a monstrous capitalistic machine that is scarier than any gigantic dragon shown in the film.","Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is yet another movie inspired by the Marvel universe that has constantly been inspiring the cinematic world for more than a decade now.

I love that we get a more in depth look at our characters, their flaws, their regrets, the tragedy in their lives- but the editing makes it feel rather out of place at times- and takes away from the impact the film could have had and its heart.

It has some brilliant, elaborate special effects that you will be gawking at on the screen, and plenty of surprises that will be bound to make you smile.

113,113,Shang-Chi and NOT the Ten Rings -_-,"As someone that really enjoys the MCU, I'm starting to wonder if COVID may have killed it. Black Widow was a meh experience and now Shang-Chi feels like more of that rote, by the numbers repetitiveness. Yes, they add a lot of Asian elements here to bring in other groups and try and lessen the white dominance of this franchise and I appreciate that but this movie felt like it was rushing through the plot to get to the next fantastical element and in so doing really robbed those moments of any lingering significance. Not to mention, the Marvel formula felt so very pronounced. It's so obvious what's going to happen in this movie from the jump and that's disappointing.

That aside, I'm a moderate fan of older Marvel comics and... THESE AREN'T THE TEN RINGS! Normally I don't mind when the MCU makes little adjustments to the source material. Comics are weird and a lot of that stuff wouldn't translate well to film, I get that but so far they've had two big, fat whiffs on anything Mandarin related. Looking at you Iron Man 3. These things are just super generic bands with pretty underwhelming powers which is so different from the 10 rings in the comics that all do something different!

Nerd rage aside, this just felt average to me. I'll probably check it out at some point again but I'm not feeling any sort of draw to revisit it soon. It's a touch more disappointing as I work through the Disney+ Marvel shows which all feel more engaging and more creative than this. Come on, Mouse. Get it together and put some of this TV magic back on the big screen!","As someone that really enjoys the MCU, I'm starting to wonder if COVID may have killed it.

Great Pacing: Shang Chi has a lot of things built into the tale as it tries to make an origin story fit so far into the movie series. With all the information, there might be worry of the pace being off, but surprisingly it is done super well. Never really dragging, but not moving a blinding pace (mostly), Shang Chi's combination tales keeps things moving but not flying over the important elements to connect with characters. The cast gets ample time to give us their backstories, piece together all the cluse of this dynamic drama puzzle, and not sacrifice on the action to come.

Character Development: The trailers may have you thinking this is a modern martial arts film, and in a sense they would be right. However, the movie takes it one step further and goes beyond the punches to instead give the characters some soul and layers compared to the legendary films of the past. Shang's life is complicated and torn between light and dark, his sister as well experiencing the drama in her own manner that parallels the main protagonist. Even the antagonist has layers far beyond what we normally get from the Marvel group, and I loved how well their lines mixed together to make this melodramatic family story fit naturally into the Marvel universe.

The Surprise Cameo: Can't say much without spoiling, but if you are like me, then you will not be disappointed who shows up in the film. Several questions are answered with this character's return and with it many laughs to be had in the manner very familiar to Marvel fans. The inclusion of this character also holds an important (albeit stretch) plot element to give a little more meaning behind it, and I loved the choices they made to include him in the big picture.

The Cultural Influence: Like Black Panther and the African Culture, Shang Chi integrates so much of the cultural values of the Asian provinces into this movie. The costumes are stunning takes on the traditional attire, bringing the past to light while also sewing in some modern styles to jazz up the outfits. Concepts of family honor, the customs to practicing Marshal Arts, and the honoring of family are well-integrated into the story and help give the predictable tale some extra Kung Fu kick. The architecture of most of the setting breathes new life to the typical cityscapes that have been made famous in Marvel, and the legends of the Ten rings scream of the Asian mythology that is seeped int heir history. I loved how well these things were merged into a Marvel tale, and though again a little predictable and flaunting, really elevated the origin story to stand out from so many others.

The CGI Finally Disney has invested in making their movies show off what the studio can do. Shan Chi and the bunch have plenty of amazing things to overuse the computer effects that the modern era loves. Special effects for the action scenes has more realism to it then Black Widow executed, the creatures you will see have a lot more polish and fluidity to their movements, and the special effects involving the ten rings are fluid and holding depth that I felt has been missing in some recent Marvel projects.

The Acting: A great part played by all members on this film, extras included, Shang Chi's cast shows that acting is not dead and characters can be utilized well. Simu Liu as the lead was fantastic, and his campaign for being in this movie could not have ended up with better results. He holds much of the prodigal martial artist, disciplined and focused to be an avid fighter capable of crushing his enemies with his style. However, he also has that troubled layer in the past to watch that helped spread his emotional spectrum. Awkwafina is still the same cooky role she always plays, but this time gets a little more balance and heroism compared to the other characters she has heralded as in the past. I loved how well she was used in this film, and how great she complemented Simu in this role. Leung brings a lot of pizazz to the character, once again giving us an antagonist with so much more than the scowl and fist, and I felt was a perfect casting to play the opponent of Shang Chi. So many other great actors and actresses in this film, but due to time restrictions I have to move on, but trust me they did well in their performances.

The Comedy: Awkwafina is often used too much for making us laugh, and Disney has struggled with forcing a lot of comedy to make it kid friendly. However, Shang Chi has taken some steps back into discipline and used the comedy well to break up the ice. Dialogue goes a long way to breaking in the laughs, with well-timed jokes and gags being the solid punch to the gut with comedy. There are several ridiculous inclusions in this film that at first seem out of place, but then roll back in to be an extravagant joke that had great set up. And the throw in references that come with it and you get a shining beacon of awesomeness that comes with this movie. It's all done so well and I was very happy with the results.

The Action: My bread and butter for most of the Marvel movies, Shang Chi delivered very well on this film's action exposé. The art of choreographed battles brings another homage to Asian culture, and with it fantastic fights that had more bite and impressive skill use then half of the Marvel cinema. It's exciting, it's dynamic, and most of the fights have a different feel to them than what you might expect. Used well in the story, there is purpose behind the inclusion of the battles and each one has a different meaning and stakes behind it than simply punching and kicking. Even more so, the strategies behind them and what is required to win, accomplishes a level of storytelling that has been lost in the modern era, so well done on that too.

A Bit More Adult: The movie is definitely showing Marvel's modernization into the 21st century, and takes a risk of making this film darker and more adult than other installments. Cursing is definitely increased in this one, with plenty of swear words filling the dialogue, but not to the point of being overdone. No F bombs, but some of the language has got a little more bite, so caution. In addition, the tone of the tale is darker, and the sunshine and rainbows of Thor, Captain America, and Guardians is left in the dust for a grittier tale, which again is a plus.

Some of the political moments: While nowhere as bad as 75% of movies today, Shang Chi does sometimes get a bit preachy with the agenda politics of the film. Taking time out to rub it in our faces with an obvious line stating, ""Look what I had to do,"" was a bit of showboating that I could have done without. Yet even this dislike is marginal, given it's very little occurring, has some nice moments that build off of it, and sometimes has a fun lesson or joke built in.

A Little More Action:

The action in this movie is great, and I loved how much of it flowed and accomplished what I was expecting of the film, and things I was not expecting. Yet there were times where a moment of fighting felt a little forced, namely the chase scenes with vehicles that seemed like an afterthought. However, the fights at the end needed some more time for me, and perhaps a little more bouncing between the battles occurring at the same time. Star Wars has done this successfully in the past, showing all manners of battling and giving you a big scope of the battle. Shang Chi has done this better than several of the Marvel films, but still had some room to give us more looks at the other characters kicking butt. The battle is lengthy enough, I'll agree to that, but a little more showing off of the other warriors would have rounded this fight to perfection for me.

The VERDICT:

Shang Chi finally made me feel like we were back into the realm of Marvel I fell in love with years ago. A cultural building world with both origin and story continuation, this hero's quest had all the makings of a fun, exciting and swift adventure we were expecting. Buried beneath the amazing fights and special effects, was a deeper movie than I had expected, using their characters well and integrating them to serve a purpose. Balanced comedy with a cultural inclusion and politics did not steal away from the main theme of the movie, and giving it that adult touch was a plus in my book, though again caution with your little ones watching it. As for limitations, I agree there is predictability and familiarity with the movie, but the fresh twist and balance helps rejuvenate the formula and add minimize the impact of the limitations for me. Though I will say a little better wider scope battle is still needed by them. Overall, my scores for this film are:

Action/Adventure/Fantasy: 9.0-9.5 Movie Overall: 8.5-9.0.","Likes

Great Pacing: Shang Chi has a lot of things built into the tale as it tries to make an origin story fit so far into the movie series. With all the information, there might be worry of the pace being off, but surprisingly it is done super well. Never really dragging, but not moving a blinding pace (mostly), Shang Chi's combination tales keeps things moving but not flying over the important elements to connect with characters. The cast gets ample time to give us their backstories, piece together all the cluse of this dynamic drama puzzle, and not sacrifice on the action to come.

Character Development: The trailers may have you thinking this is a modern martial arts film, and in a sense they would be right. However, the movie takes it one step further and goes beyond the punches to instead give the characters some soul and layers compared to the legendary films of the past. Shang's life is complicated and torn between light and dark, his sister as well experiencing the drama in her own manner that parallels the main protagonist. Even the antagonist has layers far beyond what we normally get from the Marvel group, and I loved how well their lines mixed together to make this melodramatic family story fit naturally into the Marvel universe.

The Surprise Cameo: Can't say much without spoiling, but if you are like me, then you will not be disappointed who shows up in the film. Several questions are answered with this character's return and with it many laughs to be had in the manner very familiar to Marvel fans. The inclusion of this character also holds an important (albeit stretch) plot element to give a little more meaning behind it, and I loved the choices they made to include him in the big picture.

The Cultural Influence: Like Black Panther and the African Culture, Shang Chi integrates so much of the cultural values of the Asian provinces into this movie. The costumes are stunning takes on the traditional attire, bringing the past to light while also sewing in some modern styles to jazz up the outfits. Concepts of family honor, the customs to practicing Marshal Arts, and the honoring of family are well-integrated into the story and help give the predictable tale some extra Kung Fu kick. The architecture of most of the setting breathes new life to the typical cityscapes that have been made famous in Marvel, and the legends of the Ten rings scream of the Asian mythology that is seeped int heir history.

118,118,Most Mystical and Beautiful Movie In History!,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is the most mystical and beautiful movie in history! The music, the special effects and the acting all take you to another world. The film leaves you wanting a Morris of your own.

The storyline follows a young man named Shang-Chi (Simu Liu). His father is a one thousand-year-old man and conqueror nicknamed The Mandarin (Tony Leung Chiu-wai), who has only ever used the infamous and all-powerful Ten Rings for evil. When the Mandarin is set to unleash infinite evil on the universe, Shang-Chi has to stop his father.

This movie is a cinematic experience. The fighting and choreography are out of this world. The long slow motion shots make the audience feel as if they are in a video game. Simu steals the show; every fight scene is flawless with his fluid movements and it proves just how hard he worked on his character for this film. Every audience falls in love with Shang-Chi; he's funny, with perfect comedic timing and he knows the balance between peace and violence. He encapsulates what the majority of young adults feel - like not being able to find their place in the world. The movie makes fans feel as if they've known Shang for years. It has wonderful flashbacks, which give the audience glimpses of his past, his pain and how his fears have shaped who he is. The film gives a wonderful all-around scope of this character that feels like a friend we've known all our life. It makes fans excited to see Shang-Chi again. Shang and his sister Xu Xialing are an iconic duo. They're both powerful and, while there's some tension due to their past, they put everything aside and let love shine through. Xialing is a role model, officially joining the Marvel Cinematic Universe's most powerful women. Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is perfect for AAPI (Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders) representation in cinema. It represents Chinese culture powerfully, shows what it's like to be an Asian-American in modern day USA, not to mention that Simu is Marvel Studios' first Asian-American superhero. Simu and Shang-Chi are writing history while also inspiring children and fans all around the world. The film delivers on all grounds; the cameos are shocking and leave you on the edge of your seat. Trying not to shout during the two post credits scenes prove to be a challenge. By the end of the movie, I wanted to sing the song ""Hotel California"" at the top of my lungs.

This film reminds you to search for who you are and let your past guide you to who you want to be. Ever since his mother died, Shang has been trained by his father to use violence. When he arrives at his mother's village, he learns how to find peace within himself and the world around him. He learns to trust himself and to use the rings for good.

I give Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 10 to 18 plus adults. It is available only in theaters September 3, 2021.

121,121,"More movies like this, please, Marvel","Thought I was feeling some Marvel fatigue after WandaVision (which started strong but ended on a bit of a whimper) and Black Widow (which wasn't terrible, but two months later I can't remember anything about it except how Florence Pugh was cool in it), but this one has rejuvenated some of my enthusiasm for the unstoppably huge MCU.

There's a satisfying origin story here, with a few small appearances from familiar characters that add spice to a host of new characters who are all quite compelling right out of the gate.

The action's great, and there's also so much of it- I liked how lots of the action felt relatively grounded by MCU standards, with neat stunt work and exciting camerawork making the action pop (it's only the final battle that gets really CGI heavy).

The humour's also more consistent than most Marvel films, with most of the jokes landing. Also cool were all the fantasy elements and creatures- they were all pretty inventive and well-executed.

I will say the one notable flaw is that there's a lot of exposition in the film's second half, but they get around that a little by having great actors like Tony Leung and Michelle Yeoh do most of the explaining (and there is a lot to explain, with this being a whole new side of the MCU and all), so it's not super noticeable.","Thought I was feeling some Marvel fatigue after WandaVision (which started strong but ended on a bit of a whimper) and Black Widow (which wasn't terrible, but two months later I can't remember anything about it except how Florence Pugh was cool in it), but this one has rejuvenated some of my enthusiasm for the unstoppably huge MCU.

129,129,Precious ... ten times,"Of course I am just riffing off, teasing and making fun of certain things with my summary line. Though there is some truth in there too - especially if you consider the last third of the movie - quite fantastical, pun intended.

But there is so much more here. And while you may have seen the bus scene already (I imagine many times), it still is quite the highlight and works wonders! Because there is even more to it than the trailer/teaser revealed! As is with the plot and the characters of the movie.

I was able to watch it on an Imax screen and let me tell you ... wow! But also wow and much respect to Marvel and Feige and anyone involved that they dared to make the first ten minutes or so in chinese! And throwing a lot of chinese terms (slang?) in there as well - throughout! That gives it a touch of authenticity. How immigrants in America or anywhere else in the world grew up. I do the same with my Greek and German/English.

It is also nice and while I am prone to be sarcastic, I really think it's a good thing to have such a major and big representation - especially nowadays with Anti-Asian hate/crime rising. All because of people blaming China and people of China for a virus ... the movie does not have that as a topic, it is entertainment after all, but in every promo and interview that the actors were involved it was something that was mentioned. Good for them and good for us, that this was made.

I am a bit biased when it comes to the MCU and this did get a pure theatrical release, instead of the Black Widow treatment (which also was available on Disney plus and the cinemas at the same time). So there is not issue when it comes to that. And if you can watch it on the big screen - you will not be dissapointed! Now waiting for the other stuff to drop ... especially after the mid credit scene, that is such a tease ... the after the credits scene might also hint at something, but the bigger tease was midway through the credits (actually almost at the beginning of them to be honest).

Sit back and enhoy the movie and the really funny characters ... and quite a few familiar faces. Some from the MCU and previous entries but also some from Asian cinema!

All because of people blaming China and people of China for a virus ... the movie does not have that as a topic, it is entertainment after all, but in every promo and interview that the actors were involved it was something that was mentioned. Good for them and good for us, that this was made.

I am a bit biased when it comes to the MCU and this did get a pure theatrical release, instead of the Black Widow treatment (which also was available on Disney plus and the cinemas at the same time). So there is not issue when it comes to that. And if you can watch it on the big screen - you will not be dissapointed! Now waiting for the other stuff to drop ... especially after the mid credit scene, that is such a tease ... the after the credits scene might also hint at something, but the bigger tease was midway through the credits (actually almost at the beginning of them to be honest).

Sit back and enhoy the movie and the really funny characters ... and quite a few familiar faces. Some from the MCU and previous entries but also some from Asian cinema! Well done!"

131,131,Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,,
132,132,The best Marvel movie so far...,"Having seen the trailer for the 2021 Marvel action movie ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" I must admit that of course I was going to watch it, but I feared it would just be another run-of-the-mill-over-the-top-CGI-fest-but-barred-of-proper-contents Marvel movie. Yet, I opted to sit down and watch it, on the notion that it was a Marvel movie. But also because of the cast that starred in it.

And yeah, this movie was over the top in terms of CGI. Of course it was, because it is a Marvel movie after all. But luckily this movie broke the formula of the archetypical Marvel movie and this actually turned out to be the best Marvel movie so far. Well, at least in my opinion. Why? Well, because of the storyline and the fact that it mixed Asian culture and lore into the Marvel cinematic universe, and it was a much needed addition to an otherwise Western-focused series of movies.

The storyline told in ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"", as written by Dave Callaham, Destin Daniel Cretton and Andrew Lanham was certainly entertaining. And the movie didn't really have a dull moment, despite the fact that it was a movie that ran for 132 minutes. I thoroughly enjoyed the entire movie from beginning to end. And for me, this was a storyline with proper contents to it, that also included interesting characters and creatures.

Visually then ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" blew me away. The CGI team really worked their magic with this movie and brought it to life in a very visually fulfilling way. Lots of nice details and jaw-dropping special effects. And the creature designs in the movie were off the charts, I really enjoyed seeing those brought to life on the screen.

The character gallery in ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" was interesting, and that applies for both the villain and good guy side.

And they had such a great cast ensemble put together for ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"", with the likes of Asian cinema heavy weighters such as Tony Chiu-Wai Leung, Michelle Yeoh and Wah Yuen. But the movie was also nicely carried by Simu Liu, whom I was not familiar with prior to this movie. And also having Awkwafina in the movie was just brilliant, because she put on a spot on performance with her comedy sidekick character. And it was interesting and nice to see Ben Kingsley return to reprise his character of Trevor Slattery.

""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" is a good combination of action and narrative storytelling, which made for a very wholesome movie. And it should be said that the action sequences were breathtaking to behold, so very, very nicely choreographed and executed on the screen, taking that traditional Wuxia elements seen in Asian movies and mixing it in with the archetypical Marvel Western-based superhero movies.

I was more than genuinely entertained by ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" and it is certainly a movie that bolsters Marvel's hold for me, as their movies tend to be super flashy with spectacular effects, but rather hollow in terms of proper entertainment and storytelling.

My rating of ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" lands on a well-deserved nine out of ten stars. Director Destin Denial Cretton ensured that this 2021 movie takes the role of the single best Marvel movie to date for me.","Having seen the trailer for the 2021 Marvel action movie ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" I must admit that of course I was going to watch it, but I feared it would just be another run-of-the-mill-over-the-top-CGI-fest-but-barred-of-proper-contents Marvel movie.

134,134,Ten Years too Late,,
135,135,Indeed legendary,"It's been ten years since Shang-Chi(Liu, charming, stoic) last saw his father, and leader of the criminal empire The Ten Rings, Wenwu(Leung, charismatic enough that we feel a lot of empathy for him, even when he does terrible things that we desperately want him to stop doing). That was also when he last spent time with his sister, Xialing(Zhang, a badass who deserves more screen time. Honestly, I'd be very surprised if she didn't, in future projects). He's joined by his friend Katy(Awkwafina, quirky, providing a lot of comic relief, something I'm told she's in general adept at), for what can best be described as a tense reunion, which allows the movie to really mine the family melodrama, one of the best elements it has. I won't give away exactly what the antagonist intends to do, only that our hero has to stop him. However, he has to figure out how, maybe even if, that is even possible.

Not quite, yet almost ""Black Panther for Asian audiences"", this does a lot for representation(including for women. Some of the best characters in this are female. In addition to the two that I've already mentioned, there is also Ying Nan(Yeoh, wise)), it is positively drenched in Chinese culture(the third act, while in ways it feels like it belongs to a completely different film than the first two, takes an especially deep dive into that. Ultimately, it is presented through a Western lens, and clearly we need to go further in this direction, still, it is a big deal that they put so much of it in an estimated $150 to 200 million major blockbuster, which will be seen by millions of people who would never consider watching an art picture, especially one focusing on a group they don't belong to), to the point where countless times, when it makes sense, major characters in this speak Mandarin to each other, rather than English, which it is subtitled into. And ""don't worry"", for those who think that the following is important: there are white people on screen, and they aren't made out to be ""less than"".

The action(each sequence of which feels distinct, belongs with the rest, and is memorable) pays tribute to many different kinds of martial arts films, acknowledging that they are standing on the shoulders of giants. Jackie Chan, wuxia, etc. The choreography is matched in skill by the cinematography. Not only are we seeing incredible fighting, the camera is dynamic, celebrating and highlighting how incredible it is. That *is* why you hire Bill Pope, the director of photography on the Matrix trilogy, two of Sam Raimi's Spider-Man entries, Darkman and Team America. The special effects are excellent. There are some issues with pacing, and certainly a chunk of this is composed almost entirely of flashbacks.

This features relatively brief but highly concentrated, surprisingly graphic gore(you know, there was a time when the fact that it's happening to beings that clearly are not human, wasn't enough to get away with this kind of thing with a PG-13 rating. Pepperidge Farm remembers), as well as a little strong language. I recommend this to any fan of comic book movie adaptations, and people passionate about diversity hiring. 8/10.","It's been ten years since Shang-Chi(Liu, charming, stoic) last saw his father, and leader of the criminal empire The Ten Rings, Wenwu(Leung, charismatic enough that we feel a lot of empathy for him, even when he does terrible things that we desperately want him to stop doing).

136,136,Very enjoyable,,
137,137,"Visually stunning, looking forward to the next one","Without spoiling anything as this story stands by itself there's going to be a sequel and I really look forward to that. It was that good in my humble opinion. Visually it was just stunning, great CGI's, very well choreographed fighting scenes, and a story that was most entertaining to watch. Some might find it over the top but it's a Marvel so what do you expect? To me this is one of Marvels best movies yet if not the best. The acting was good as well, and that from the whole cast. I never heard of Shang-Chi before but from now he has one more fan. Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings won't disappoint a lot of people, unless you're just not into this genre of movies. A must see for the fans.","Without spoiling anything as this story stands by itself there's going to be a sequel and I really look forward to that. It was that good in my humble opinion.

I found it something special and liked it a lot just until the journey starts and another world opens. From there on we came into a fiction world with dragons and monsters.

It's there that this flick lost my attention towards the story. It takes a while before the action comes back in. But once the fights are on, the effects are really stunning.

Mixed feelings aboutthe result, not bada fter all but with the other world coming in, it lost some points in the rating for me.

Nevertheless, some funny parts here and there added and they worked out fine.

140,140,A Marvel for the whole family.,"""The US government was almost toppled by a pretender named after an orange."" Wenwu (Tony Leung)

This quote is typical of the light-hearted but also serious addition to the MCU that is Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings. Although Marvel has always been less serious than DC, this time it leaves Superman and Batman to cry in their capes. Sweet superhero Sean/Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) has more humanity than almost any other hero, and he uses his martial arts only when pressed.

The opening sequence on a bus (you can see the bad coming from other cinematic bus rides such as in Nobody) is rousing and entertaining. It has a fight sequence I laughed through because of its ballet-like composition but satisfying because it sets up character and motivation.

When things get heavy, and they do because Sean must confront and potentially kill his 1000-year-old mobster dad, Wenwu, Awkwafina's Katy, Sean's girlfriend, is there with amusing one-liners throughout the adventure, right down to a life-saving shot in the big ending battle scene.

Director Destin Daniel Cretton deftly orchestrates his fights and his characters' lines with the authority of a much more seasoned filmmaker. He never loses sight of the central motif-the affirmation of family primacy, so that the potential chaos of a giant cast and multiple plot strands hosts a unity glued by character and dialogue.

Shang-Chi is a Marvel for the whole family and especially the cinephiles curious how The Marvel Cinematic Universe can be so diverse, so entertaining, and so perfect a purveyor of our heroic fantasies.","""The US government was almost toppled by a pretender named after an orange.""

142,142,The legend of the ten Marvel movies a year for all eternity.,"'Shang-Chi And The Legend Of The Ten Rings (2021)' is, essentially, exactly what you expect it to be. Not only does it feel like a Marvel movie, it feels like a literal Disney movie as well. This is often detrimental to the overall affair, as the piece should have been much more unique than it ultimately is, and it makes for a much less interesting watch overall. However, the formula it follows has provided plenty of success in the past; this time is no exception. Its highs are where you'd expect them to be, as are its lows, and there is an undeniable sense of fun, albeit cookie-cutter fun, to be had. The film is an entertaining action adventure that follows a young man whose criminal father calls him and his sister back home in order to lay siege to the mystical village he believes is holding his wife, the protagonist's mother, hostage. The villain's motivation is a little underexplored yet entirely understandable. It comes from a believable emotional place and is more satisfying because of it. The relationship between the lead and his no-good dad isn't explored as much as it could be, though, and the flick generally has a bit of a theming issue. The piece tries to tie its events directly into the wants and needs of its lead characters, but it does so in an unsatisfyingly half-baked way and honestly would probably have been better if it played itself as more of a straightforward adventure ala most of the 'Mission: Impossible (1996-)' series. Still, the touches of character development are appreciated and each lead player is written to be as likeable as possible. This, combined with the amicable performances, means that you care about the heroes even though you don't have all that much reason to. This keeps you invested in their stories throughout. The highlight of the entire affair is, for sure, its action. For the most part, the picture stays towards the right end of the practical to CG spectrum. The fights are never exactly realistic, per se, but they're based on competent choreography and clean camerawork. They're, more often than not, really entertaining. Sadly, the flick inches closer and closer towards the wrong end of the aforementioned spectrum the longer it goes on. By the time it reaches its finale (which gives me major 'Fast And Furious Presents Hobbs And Shaw (2019)' vibes for some reason), it's clear that the balance it previously achieved is going to go out of the window. Sure enough, its climactic battle is an entirely computer-generated affair; it isn't all that compelling and goes directly against what made the movie so enjoyable to begin with. No matter how hard it tries to disguise it, it still ends with a big blue beam in the sky. Still, the finale isn't exactly bad. It's just annoyingly intangible and feels a little forced in, even (as do the rather cringe-worthy post-credits scenes). Ultimately, this is a generic yet entertaining experience. Its charming acting and exciting action are clearly its highlights, and its weakest aspects are still decent enough. It's a good movie. However, I can't deny that Marvel fatigue is becoming more and more pertinent in my mind. You know what you're going to get before you get it. Plus, the studio's insistence that it has to perforate every single outing with references to other, almost entirely irrelevant fare is really annoying. Although most of their movies are at least okay, I find myself not caring at all about them. That's sad, really, considering that the MCU has produced some genuinely great pictures in the past. 7/10.","'Shang-Chi And The Legend Of The Ten Rings (2021)' is, essentially, exactly what you expect it to be.

143,143,Fun martial arts action-comedy with some dragon ex machina,"After a flashback, this movie jumps to a couple of slackers, Shaun and Katy, with Shaun proving during a wild bus ride that he is much more than a car attendant. Soon they're on a globe hoping adventure with world-saving dimensions.

The martial arts choreography is terrific, from the opening forest fight through that fantastic bus bit to the final hand-to-hand battle (followed by the big special effects battle seemingly required in every Marvel film). Fights are funny and exciting and that final battle is truly suspenseful.

The cast is also excellent. Awkwafina is as funny as ever, Michelle Yeoh and Tony Leung bring all their seasoned expertise to their roles, and the actors are don't know are also first rate.

Although ... in the case of Simu Liu, who plays Shaun/Shang-Chi, I have no strong opinion. He's a pleasant every man who handles the action scenes well but seems less mythic hero than ""genial best friend of the main character."" With all the other talent on screen he doesn't manage to leave much of an impression, but on the bright side I don't object to him.

The story is fun, the movie does a good job of mixing humor, action, and tragical reminiscences the pace is terrific, and man there are some great fights.

WOWOWOWOWOW. This movie blew me away. I love it. A LOT. From beginning to end. Everything. I walked out of the movie so hyped, silent-screaming under my mask as i walked to the car. It's been a while since i walked out of a movie this happy. I have so much to say.

I love the MCU (a lot), but there are a few things that are frequently lacking. One of them is good fight scenes. They always have awesome action scenes, but specifically fight scenes are usually pretty good, only great in a few movies like civil war and winter soldier. And in general, fight scenes in American movies pale in comparison to Asian cinema (Ip man, The Raid Redemption, anything Jackie Chan).

The fight scenes in this movie.... how do i describe it... amazing martial arts that's fast but clear, filmed in creative and astonishing ways without a hint of shaky cam or quick cuts, against stunningly beautiful backdrops... phenomenal. And they continuously focus on the fights instead of cutting to a different scene after 10 seconds like i've noticed in the MCU.

This is BY FAR the best fighting in the MCU and it's not even close. Has to be up there with the John Wick series and Netflix's Daredevil as some of the best we've seen in America lately. I loved the first major fight scene so much that i was worried it would be the best one of the movie, far too early. Lol. I be stupid sometimes

Another frequent flaw in the MCU is lack of compelling villain. Nope. Awesome awesome awesome. That's all i'll say.

Another of my frequent complaints is that the musical scores, with some exceptions, don't stand out. I think they heard. They're on a good streak with the shows and Black Widow. It's not as amazing as the Loki score but i liked it. It felt unique to this new franchise.

Still so much more to say, need to go faster. This is one of the best, maybe THE best, story in the MCU, especially the way it's told. I loved all the characters, i loved all the casting choices, i loved the performances. There are scenes of dialogue that gave me goosebumps. All the emotional moments hit. All the callbacks hit. There isn't anything that didn't work for me. There's no such thing as a perfect movie, but mannnnnn.

Lmao i didn't mention the cinematography. Why would i wait this long? It's MESMERIZING. A lot. Throughout. It's candy for your eyes.

It's also nice to see well-written comedy with jokes relevant to the scene and characters, that feels organic. As opposed to the ""insert joke here"" method we've been seeing more of, especially in Far From Home.

What's the opposite of formulaic? That's this movie. I never knew what to expect next (helps that i didn't watch a single trailer, they ruin movies). Definitely doesn't feel like a typical MCU movie. It has it's own unique tone and feel and character.

Continuing what i said in my headline, i have this thing where i get goosebumps and start tearing up, not from an emotional moment, but from a scene being so incredible, especially action scenes. Don't know why it happens, don't know if it happens to other ppl. Maybe it's partly because i can't risk blinking. That happened in this movie numerous times. Like ""this is the coolest thing i've ever seen in my life."" hyperbole, but mannnnn

after endgame finished phase 3 (yes i know spider-man), i was so happy and satisfied with the MCU. But i wasn't sure they could ever recapture that magic again. I knew i would watch everything and it would probably mostly be awesome. But i wasn't expecting top-tier stuff any more. Lol. I be stupid sometimes. I am ecstatic to have that notion obliterated. As of now, this is a top 6 MCU movie for me. Wow

All in all, i adore this movie. You may wonder why i wouldn't give it a 10 after all this raving. 10s are super rare for me, only 13 of them, and i watch thousands of movies. Interstellar, inception, mad max fury road, etc. Movies that shouldn't even be called movies. My 9s are rare too, they are my favorite movies. 10s are my favorites of my favorites. Only superhero movies i've given 10s are dark knight, dark knight rises and civil war.

If you're still reading, wow you're awesome! I think this is my longest review other than Interstellar.

I'm still in such a good mood. I can't wait to watch it again, in IMAX. I want to wait a week so it feels fresher, but i might not be able to!

His impersonator from ""Iron Man 3"", played by Ben Kingsley is there and is a lot of fun. It's a nice throwback to the older Marvel films and a good way to satisfy the fans. I like how there's two people of the same gender who are not love interests.

We get some absolutely amazing fight scenes which seem right out of a classic Chinese martial arts movie. My only complaint is that it is a bit too long. It's still amazing with gorgeous designs of the creatures. It truly is a unique film to have a mostly all-Asian cast in a superhero movie.

Here we go...

I'm not feeling this movie. It starts with promise but It lost me after Wong vs Abomb.

The fighting is exciting. The movie lacks excitement though. It's a plain dull movie.

It's about a Karate master and... yeah the movie lost me and I have know idea what it's about. This is the first mcu film that I lost interest for midway. Even Im3 wasn't so bad because I lost interest from the very beginning.

Gotg2, mcu Spiderman 1/2 and IM3 are still the worse in mcu. Shang Chi just joined the club.

A movie so full of emptiness that it makes an empty box jealous

I'm not sure how this is a 7. Fans and the average movie goer should also be held responsible for horrible movies.

This movie ain't a 7 even if you watched this movie as blind and drunk.

They tried to be funny by having Wong be rude by drinking the couple's drink at the end credit scene. That wasn't funny at all. Wizard or not.

Speaking of funny, I didn't laugh once. When I used to watch these movies in theatres, the audience often told me when I should have laughed. I watched it at home, therefore I didn't know my cue of when to laugh.

The mcu needs to chill with the daddy issue plot

THOR Loki daddy issue Black Panta daddy issues Stark Daddy issues Star lord Daddy issues Ultron daddy issues Nebula and Gamora daddy issues Shang daddy issue Wasp daddy issues Scott langs daughter Daddy issues

No one has mommy issues.

161,161,"Epic, stunning, and a strong powerhouse story.","5 out of 5 stars.

Shang-Chi and the legend of the Ten Rings is an awesome and exciting mcu film that brings the stunning world with the asian culture. I will say i enjoyed this more than the previous mcu film Black Widow. Shang Chi introduces a new mcu character played by Simu Liu. And Awkwafina which is also a fun addition. While they are being chased by an organization called ten rings. Lead by his father Tony Leung. While Shang Chi learns his abilities and the ten rings. Before his father is trying to use that power for a personal reason.

Great epic plot. Shang Chi and Katy (Awkwafina) enter a hidden world Ta Lao where there is magical mythical creatures. Is like a wow stunning moment when you first see Wakanda in Black Panther. The film does give an emotional story build up and a villain that can be relatable.

The cast ensemble is great. Simu Liu did great with the character along with Awkwafina as his friend. Meng'er Zhang, Michelle Yeoh, Benedict Wong, Florian Munteanu, and Tong Leung all did great.

The set designs and visual effects are stunning and great. Can be colorful at moments. The music score was good as well. The action sequences are great and exciting. Every set piece had an awesome martial arts choreography which was well shot with the cinematography. Director did a great job in capturing the action and fight sequences. Even with the epic climax of the dragon battle.

There are two mid and post credit scene which sets up for further films and has a fun nod to the mcu.

I will say Shang Chi is a great exciting addition and i found the film to be very fast moving. Action packed. And a great family conflict story that is emotionally driven.","5 out of 5 stars.

162,162,A Marvel-ous martial arts joy,"Showing no signs of slowing down hot off the heels of Black Widow, a raft of well-received Disney+ series and arriving not too far in front of the hotly anticipated The Eternals, Marvel continues to put in work that puts many other wheelhouses too shame, with the marital arts infused Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, yet another entry into the brands increasingly loaded catalogue of quality blockbuster releases.

It's hard to pinpoint exactly what Marvel keep doing to maintain the momentum that started all those years ago with 2008's Iron Man, it's absolutely correct when many say a lot of these origin stories and event pictures follow a very set formula from A to B, but with an ability to attract some of the best actors working in the industry today and handpicking a raft of some of the most exciting Hollywood filmmakers around, Marvel have once more struck gold with the incredibly fun and inventive Shang-Chi.

Quite possibly the most visually sumptuous Marvel film yet, sometimes feeling as if Marvel has meet with Ang Lee/Yimou Zhang and in my mind the Marvel film that features the best choregraphed action scenes yet from the spectacle heavy brand, Shang-Chi is a big screen blast that is freshly directed by the upcoming Destin Daniel Cretton who here has got his just rewards after his great debut Short Term 12 and the sadly undervalued The Glass Castle came before this big-budgeted ride.

Infusing his film with a great energy and charm that is enhanced by the work of leads Simu Liu (in a career launching turn) as our likable hero Shaun/Shang-Chi, Awkwafina (doing her usual but fun schtick) as Shaun's bestie Katy and Tony Leung as the unfortunate villain of the piece Xu Wenwu, Cretton has turned out to be the perfect choice to start off the cinematic journey of the fist swinging Shang-Chi and helps instill in his film some nice differences to what we've come to expect from comic book blockbusters of the modern era.

Most notably for the film is the exciting use of hand to hand combat that is delivered spectacularly in two stand out sequences on board a moving bus and then bettered alongside a high rise building in Macau, both these set pieces are easily some of the most noteworthy of any Marvel film yet while also benefiting the film other than its Asian infused eccentricities is the fun relationship between Shang-Chi and Katy than never bothers with adding extra baggage to add weight to their believable and fun friendship.

If there was a major drawback to Shang-Chi's many wins it is in an overdrawn finale, a major problem many have acknowledged previously when it comes to Marvel films, Cretton and his team can't quite stick the landing for Shang-Chi with it being a little too long in the tooth for its own good and slightly overblown and while it features some incredible imagery and technical wizardry, the films rip-roaring start and strong middle section gives way too something lesser.

Final Say -

Another huge win for Marvel who have here with the help of director Destin Daniel Cretton and his talented cast, created an instantly likable cinematic universe that provides the comic kings with one of their most unique and exciting playgrounds yet.

4 chicken-pigs out of 5.","Showing no signs of slowing down hot off the heels of Black Widow, a raft of well-received Disney+ series and arriving not too far in front of the hotly anticipated The Eternals, Marvel continues to put in work that puts many other wheelhouses too shame, with the marital arts infused Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, yet another entry into the brands increasingly loaded catalogue of quality blockbuster releases.

163,163,Not bad,"The opening fight scene is worth the watch, but the cameos steal the show. I won't go in to detail. The Marvel geeks will know what I mean, because there are plenty to count even the hidden ones.

The movie is good and I like the casting. The direction is okay but the cinematography is the best.

The ending is anti climatic. I found it to be cliche. However it is worth the watch. It is nice to see a movie like this and I believe it is a good addition to your watch list.","The opening fight scene is worth the watch, but the cameos steal the show. I won't go in to detail.

164,164,Yet another superb stand-alone superhero flick in MCEU's kitty.,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (2021) : Brief Review -

Yet another superb stand-alone superhero flick in MCEU's kitty. MCEU's new phase never looked so promising but their products are delivering Better than expected. That Spider Man flick in 2019, right after Endgame, changed many perceptions about Marvel's future and even though couple of their recent series like 'Wanda Vision' and 'Loki' couldn't emerge as clear winners, they have set a solid base for upcoming new stories. Shang-Chi is a new start by all means. Not only because it comes under new phase but mainly because it is a stand-alone film and with a new superhero who is more like using traditional combat methods along with ancient superpowers. When Captain America or Black Panther begun as Stand-alone films, they promised too much and thankfully fulfilled it. Shang-Chi does the same. It may not promise too much like Steve Rogers and Wakanda stories but the point where it ends surely gives us hints of new assembled version of superheroes in Multiverse. Shang-Chi, the master of unarmed weaponry-based Kung Fu, is forced to confront his past after being drawn into the Ten Rings organization. The film has major portion covered by Family values and hence, it may look predictable but does not bore at all. Yes, few scenes are outdated and too dramatic as if we are watching a Superhero Film made in 90s but let's just forget those weak points as Shang Chi has excelled in Visual spectacle. The screenplay could have been better in the second half when the big War was supposed to take place but it actually looks tiny one except for those two humongous dragons which might remind you of 'The Hobbit'. Performances by Simu Li, Awkwafina, Meng'er Zhang, Fala Chen, Florian Munteanu are fine according to less potential available for the roles. Actually, the humour and tone of these characters was great. They all looked normal people when they were not fighting and even though the film has ancient refrences, the character don't actually go too deep to become expressive. Director Destin Daniel Cretton seemed slightly off track in the beginning when he tries to humanise all the characters with that typically teenage humor but as the film goes ahead, he recovers from the childish entanglement. With super explosive climax he surely makes up for his mistakes, rather makes us forgive it. Overall, Shang Chi is another superb entertainer for Marvel Fanboys and even neutrals are gonna enjoy it.

RATING - 7/10*

165,165,This could've been great if it wasn't for the cheesy writing.,"The story was riddled with holes and plot issues. Since when does Awkwafina's pedestrian character all of a sudden get invited to become part of the MCU team? What's her super power... stupidity? Don't get me wrong, I love her, but her character was lazily written. Then there's the whole daddy issues dynamic - Shang is with him, then against, then with etc.. Then we have these ridiculous dragons fighting, where one scores some power crystals and becomes stronger! This is just infantile lazy writing. There was zero shock value or anything spectacular in the entire runtime, with tedious long middle acts and a bumbling third act. The jokes were cliched and not funny. The funniest parts were Ben Kingsley's character, (of whom was in this for what reasons??) and the ending to go Karaoke - which was the only time I actually cracked a chuckle. You'd think with three writers we'd have something cohesive and coherent. But instead of a Marvel superhero story, we got a Disney evil vs good with dragons thrown into the mix. It's as if they tried too hard to create the Asian version of Black Panther.

It's a shame, because the directing and cinematography were spot on, and great S/VFX - although a little overboard with the CGI i.e. Dragons. The martial arts choreography was outstanding (although again, overboard after the awesome bus scene), and the casting and performances were excellent, especially Leung, who pretty much carried the film on his shoulders. It's a 7/10 from me.","The story was riddled with holes and plot issues. Since when does Awkwafina's pedestrian character all of a sudden get invited to become part of the MCU team?

166,166,8 Rings out of 10,"For the first time in a couple of years, since 2019's ""Captain Marvel"" the MCU introduces us to a brand new hero. Simu Liu who, rather impressively, first asked for the role on Twitter brings us Shang-Chi in a film that perhaps does have some issues with it's ending, but ultimately is a fun, funny ride of the type Marvel have been perfecting for the last 13 years.

Talented, but somewhat aimless, Shaun (Simu Liu) lives in San Francisco working as a valet with his friend Katy (Awkwafina). When he's attacked on a bus, he's forced back into the world of his father, a ruthless terrorist Xu Wenwu (Tony Chiu-Wai Leung). First visiting his sister, then returning to the Ten Rings compound, Shang-Chi decides to use his skills to defend his late mothers sacred homeland against invasion from his father and for control of ten mystical arm rings, weapons that grant their owner immortality and unearthly power.

If ""Black Widow"" was considered a wobble for the MCU, despite the fact I thought that it's a perfectly fine film, then it was important to come back with something that was undeniably excellent. ""Shang-Chi"" was that. It's the perfect balance of humour and action that Marvel have established over the last few years. The action too is tweaked slightly, to more closely resemble the types of Asian led action films that we've seen previously, be that the Jackie Chan style bus fight, or the ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon""-esque flashback fight between Shang Chi's parents. There's some lovely links to the wider MCU, including a return for Benedict Wong's Wong and for Trevor Slattery, Ben Kingsley's ""Iron Man 3"" character whose masquerading role as The Mandarin was one of the MCU's most divisive moments.

It's not perfect. The ending is perhaps a little rushed and lacking a moment or two of redemption earning for Xu Wenwu, but the peaks at the future for the character, and for the 10 Rings organisation is an interesting addition, plus our first real step on what might be the route to the next big bad. Excellent stuff.","For the first time in a couple of years, since 2019's ""Captain Marvel"" the MCU introduces us to a brand new hero.

Much fighting ensues but fortunately everyone eventually learns how to 'get along' when faced with a real threat. You have seen it all before: physics-defying martial arts, monsters who look like the recently swallowed strings of LED Christmas lights, conflicted heroes with wise-cracking 'comic relief' sidekicks (an awful Aquafina and an even more awful Ben Kingsley), giant melees featuring a variety of glowing weapons (but no blood), hyper-kinetic and hyper-implausible car/motorcycle chases, and a lot of clichéd wisecracks, tough-guy dialogue, poseur slo-mo, and heroic vogueing (we're treated to the venerable three-point power landing/slide a number of times). The only novel thing the film has to offer is the excellent rendering of mythological beasts from Chinese culture; otherwise, it's an overly-long (132 minutes, which is 120 minutes too much Aquafina), derivative, repetitive, and ultimately boring entry in the bloated, jejune Micky Mouse-Marvel superhero franchise.","Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) discovers that his all-powerful and millennium-old father is about to launch an attack against the magical village where Shang-Chi's mother was born in the likely mistaken belief that his wife is not dead but is rather being held captive (there is more to the plot than one sentence can sum up but what does it matter... the story is just scaffolding for the special effects).

170,170,Promises good things for MCU's Phase Four,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings stars Simu Liu in the lead role alongside such heavy names as Tony Leung and Michelle Yeoh in this latest installment to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Liu's Shang-Chi must come to his own as the son of the legendary Mandarin (Leung), the owner of the Ten Rings.

I like this film's style most of all. Director Destin Daniel Cretton mixes Chinese wuxia settings and aesthetics with Hong Kong wire kung fu inspired action set pieces, while still keeping it feeling like a Marvel film. There's a surprising amount of callbacks and nods to the larger Marvel universe, pleasing dedicated fans, but the film is still able to stand on its own feet and introduce us to its hero.

Kudos also to the whole filming for these action scenes. Very little shaky cam or jump cuts, especially for the hand to hand scenes. Exactly as it should be. I'd dare to say that this film has some of, if not the best action set pieces in all of MCU.

One of the most thrilling and visually spectacular end battles as well, come to think of it.

Furthermore, the acting is solid, especially from Liu, Leung and Awkwafina, who plays Shang-Chi's American friend. Meng'er Zhang as Xialing, Shang-Chi's younger sister, was perhaps my only real gripe with the film. I could have used either a bit more edge to her or alternatively a lot less. Now she seemed to flipflop between relatable and aggravating.

All in all, not the best Marvel movie by any means, but that's a really high bar to clear. I can simply say that based on this, I'm very optimistic about MCU's continued future.","Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings stars Simu Liu in the lead role alongside such heavy names as Tony Leung and Michelle Yeoh in this latest installment to the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

171,171,The Master of kung fu was really good but not as good as I wanted it to be.,"It was better than the proceeding Marvel movie Black Window. More exceeding the expectations of a Marvel movie. Shang-Chi feels like the marvel movie experience is starting to get back to the normal of the theme ride Martian Scorsese believes they are (I can't disagree, just note that's what I want)

In comparison Shang-Chi is a lower level character. I am a fan of Marvel comics but got more of the references to the Marvel Cinematic Universe in this movie than to the direct comic book references. Those Marvel cinematic universe references were amazing enough to get over the fact that the obvious comic book ones went over my head. I mean this movie's connection to other movies is great fanfare that makes me love it more. So really cool cameos happen that actually move the story along.

I did like what they did with the Mandarin here but do feel they copied and paste a lot of things into the story of Shang-Chi to make a complete movie for a lower level character. From the little I know of the character he more fits into those Netflix's shows they did a few years back but change him enough to justify a blockbuster.

They did succeed in making Shang-Chi's background more fuller. The relationship between him and his father and sister was beautiful, complex and more importantly, never bored me and of course Awkafina as the comedy relief and best friend to Shang-Chi was strategic gold. The story for the background was not that full. It's really a character driven movie for without the amazing performances from a group of actors who know their stuff this story would fall short.

Note, I loved the fact that Michelle Yeoh was in this movie and that gives it a lot, but she's done way better in less effective films (but she most likely got a huge paycheck from Disney just to wave her hands around).

The special effects were good in this flick. I was impress with what was used to make the final conflict and I was convince that the dude from Kim's Convenience was a master of kung fu

Its a good movie but it did not live up to my high expectations of it. It gave me a lot of cool things but really did not give me anything I did not see before, in movies that did it better, but if it's about anything I did spend the rest of the day pretending I knew Kung fu.","It was better than the proceeding Marvel movie Black Window.

173,173,Finally a new kind of marvel story,,
174,174,An easy watch that fits into the MCU well,"A San Francisco valet finds his past catching up with him in spectacular fashion.

This is an entertaining superhero adventure story with an Asian martial arts theme and a number of entertaining scenes.

Like many introductions to superhero characters there is a bit of backstory to go through and this film does it with flashback sequences in a similar way to 'Black Panther'. These are mixed with the action, humour and unfolding narrative of the present day plot. Additionally there is some important exposition added relating to the Marvel multiverse. Personally I think everything depicted could have been done in more than one movie, and not so rushed, but that's just a personal preference. What is presented is not complicated in anyway, but very simplified, presumably so that it can be established quickly and the likes of Shang-Chi and Katy can share screens with other MCU characters as soon as possible.

The tone and general feel of the movie also reminds me of the approach taken with 'Black Panther', particularly when it focusses on a location that, like Wakanda, mixes the sights and sounds of regional culture with the sci-fi fantasy. It has obviously been written carefully so that it displays imagery associated with far-Eastern culture like martial arts, traditional costuming, rural settings, that is marketable to a Western audience, but at the same time it avoids other commonly associated negative stereotyping like exaggerated accents, sorcery, yellow peril, bad driving, and (thankfully) gong sounds. Much of this is drenched with a liberal amount of fast-talking contemporary American humour.

There are a number of highly enjoyable scenes such as the fight sequence on the bus, the various comedy moments, virtually everything that comes out of Ben Kingsley's mouth, and all the flashback scenes. The final dinner table scene is probably my favourite.

Visually as you can imagine it is beautiful and full of top drawer cinematography, editing, and technology-driven effects. For me though the spectacle goes over-the-top, particularly in the final action sequence.

Most actors are solid such as Simu Liu, Tony Leung, Meng'er Zhang, Michelle Yeoh, Fala Chen, and Benedict Wong. The standout performances for me easily are Nora Lum and Ben Kingsley who have buckets of charisma and the advantage of all the best lines.

Overall there is little to criticise, it just feels like what Martin Scorsese described perfectly in 2019 as a theme park rather than cinema.","A San Francisco valet finds his past catching up with him in spectacular fashion.

Most actors are solid such as Simu Liu, Tony Leung, Meng'er Zhang, Michelle Yeoh, Fala Chen, and Benedict Wong. The standout performances for me easily are Nora Lum and Ben Kingsley who have buckets of charisma and the advantage of all the best lines.

Overall there is little to criticise, it just feels like what Martin Scorsese described perfectly in 2019 as a theme park rather than cinema."

But when drastic circumstances draw him back to his conspicuous origins, he has no choice but to face his demons head on. Continuing to expand its cultural horizon the MCU's first Asian-centric movie has unique choreography, a dazzling visual scheme, splendid hand-to-hand combat, and of course the expected teases going forward, but some of the more elaborate action set pieces lack needed tension, much of the exposition and backstory isn't very engaging, and up until the third act many of the emotional aspects of the narrative aren't as rich or compelling as they could be. Some of the humor is strained, but it's efficiently cast and provides enough to be a distinctive entry into the Marvel world. **½","Eluding his difficult past, a young man from China has been content playing it safe in San Francisco for the past several years even though he lacks a true sense of self.

180,180,Marvel Sprinkles a Different Flavor into the MCU,"Marvel gets mystical in this mashup of the plucky, familiar MCU character and the more stoic, legend-heavy air of wuxia films. It's a fresh mix, effectively breaking the gravity of its more serious moments with a well-timed jape while lending credence and lore to a lesser-known corner of the comic kingdom, but these crossover moments sometimes test their limits. I could see more grounded viewers being turned off by the dragons and soul-sucking demons (far cry from the feasible reality of the first Iron Man, that) while serious fans of Chinese fantasy are bucked by the constant injection of loose wit and slappy one-liners.

When it's rolling, Shang Chi does manage to toe that line and deliver something appropriately new and versatile, a good reflection of both worlds. It benefits from a tight pair of central performances (Simu Liu and Awkwafina as a team of underachieving twenty-somethings) and several big, powerful action sets (the articulated bus fight might be one of the best combat scenes Marvel's ever put out) while tying in a dangling thread or two from earlier films to provide a sense of greater connection. On several occasions, however, it's guilty of being too self-indulgent and losing the narrative. It's great to see Ben Kingsley again, adding nuance to his part in Iron Man 3, but his scenes are the main offender here; excessive and distracting and way too cute.

The action is strong, the dialogue (mostly) works, the scenery looks great, but in the big picture, Shang Chi feels small-scale and disposable. Non-completionists won't miss anything crucial if they choose to skip it.","Marvel gets mystical in this mashup of the plucky, familiar MCU character and the more stoic, legend-heavy air of wuxia films.

183,183,Marvel movie by the numbers with beautiful dragons and charming locations,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is yet another movie inspired by the Marvel universe that has constantly been inspiring the cinematic world for more than a decade now. While the movie follows the usual stereotypes, it manages to stand out with its stunning special effects and locations.

The movie revolves around Shaun, a Chinese immigrant living in the United States of America who is working as a valet with his quirky friend and soulmate Katy. One day, they get attacked by a group of assassins on a bus and only just manage to survive. Shaun immediately understands that the attack must be related to his influential estranged father. Along with Katy, he decides to team up with his tough estranged sister Xialing to find out what's going on.

This film convinces on multiple levels. First of all, the acting performances are quite quirky and convincing. Especially the ladies steal the show. Awkwafina delivers the goods as curious, dynamic and funny woman that anyone would like to have as a friend. Zhang Meng'er on the other side represents a much darker character shaped by dramatic events from the past who is much more difficult to approach with her tough, relentless and independent personality.

The expensive special effects certainly deliver the goods as well. The scenes in a fantasy world, in Ancient China and in contemporary San Francisco are all equally stunning to watch. The fantastic creatures such as dragons look impressive on the big screen.

The story might be predictable but is nevertheless entertaining from start to finish thanks to steady pace and inspired execution. You will truly care about the fates of the different characters as you are watching this film.

However, this film isn't without its occasional flaws. First of all, lead actor Simu Liu simply doesn't have the charisma of the other actresses and actors involved. Casting him was a bold choice but it didn't fully pay off in my opinion.

Up next, the movie desperately tries to connect to other characters in the Marvel Universe. The appearance of Trevor Slattery played by Ben Kingsley is completely random as it only seems to be a pretext to offer some misplaced comic relief. The mid-credit scene starts in an amusing fashion but suddenly involving Bruce Banner and Carol Danvers only seems like a weak attempt to develop a hype for potential sequels. The same goes for yet another scene after the credits that evokes more questions rather than concluding the film appropriately.

At the end of the day, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is an entertaining fantasy action film of the Marvel Universe that should appeal to faithful and occasional fans alike. It's one of the better films in the franchise but perhaps Marvel should focus on quality over quantity instead of becoming a monstrous capitalistic machine that is scarier than any gigantic dragon shown in the film.","Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is yet another movie inspired by the Marvel universe that has constantly been inspiring the cinematic world for more than a decade now.

My main problems with the film lie in the films storyline, which to be honest, is really good, but incredibly all over the place editing wise and there is just so much of it that it feels like two movies could have been made out of it. I love that we get a more in depth look at our characters, their flaws, their regrets, the tragedy in their lives- but the editing makes it feel rather out of place at times- and takes away from the impact the film could have had and its heart. That being said, the film still manages to be very enjoyable throughout. The action scenes are absolutely incredible, the look of the film incredibly well developed- something very fresh and original for Marvel studios- and the cast are all a joy to watch- especially Simu Liu and Aquafina in the lead and supporting roles. I was skeptical of Aquafina being in a Marvel movie for sure, but she really helped the film as a whole, and honestly I would love to see more of her character in future Marvel projects. The film is entertaining, despite the pacing of the film being a bit all over the place at times. It has some brilliant, elaborate special effects that you will be gawking at on the screen, and plenty of surprises that will be bound to make you smile.

188,188,Shang-Chi and NOT the Ten Rings -_-,"As someone that really enjoys the MCU, I'm starting to wonder if COVID may have killed it. Black Widow was a meh experience and now Shang-Chi feels like more of that rote, by the numbers repetitiveness. Yes, they add a lot of Asian elements here to bring in other groups and try and lessen the white dominance of this franchise and I appreciate that but this movie felt like it was rushing through the plot to get to the next fantastical element and in so doing really robbed those moments of any lingering significance. Not to mention, the Marvel formula felt so very pronounced. It's so obvious what's going to happen in this movie from the jump and that's disappointing.

That aside, I'm a moderate fan of older Marvel comics and... THESE AREN'T THE TEN RINGS! Normally I don't mind when the MCU makes little adjustments to the source material. Comics are weird and a lot of that stuff wouldn't translate well to film, I get that but so far they've had two big, fat whiffs on anything Mandarin related. Looking at you Iron Man 3. These things are just super generic bands with pretty underwhelming powers which is so different from the 10 rings in the comics that all do something different!

Nerd rage aside, this just felt average to me. I'll probably check it out at some point again but I'm not feeling any sort of draw to revisit it soon. It's a touch more disappointing as I work through the Disney+ Marvel shows which all feel more engaging and more creative than this. Come on, Mouse. Get it together and put some of this TV magic back on the big screen!","As someone that really enjoys the MCU, I'm starting to wonder if COVID may have killed it.

Great Pacing: Shang Chi has a lot of things built into the tale as it tries to make an origin story fit so far into the movie series. With all the information, there might be worry of the pace being off, but surprisingly it is done super well. Never really dragging, but not moving a blinding pace (mostly), Shang Chi's combination tales keeps things moving but not flying over the important elements to connect with characters. The cast gets ample time to give us their backstories, piece together all the cluse of this dynamic drama puzzle, and not sacrifice on the action to come.

Character Development: The trailers may have you thinking this is a modern martial arts film, and in a sense they would be right. However, the movie takes it one step further and goes beyond the punches to instead give the characters some soul and layers compared to the legendary films of the past. Shang's life is complicated and torn between light and dark, his sister as well experiencing the drama in her own manner that parallels the main protagonist. Even the antagonist has layers far beyond what we normally get from the Marvel group, and I loved how well their lines mixed together to make this melodramatic family story fit naturally into the Marvel universe.

The Surprise Cameo: Can't say much without spoiling, but if you are like me, then you will not be disappointed who shows up in the film. Several questions are answered with this character's return and with it many laughs to be had in the manner very familiar to Marvel fans. The inclusion of this character also holds an important (albeit stretch) plot element to give a little more meaning behind it, and I loved the choices they made to include him in the big picture.

The Cultural Influence: Like Black Panther and the African Culture, Shang Chi integrates so much of the cultural values of the Asian provinces into this movie. The costumes are stunning takes on the traditional attire, bringing the past to light while also sewing in some modern styles to jazz up the outfits. Concepts of family honor, the customs to practicing Marshal Arts, and the honoring of family are well-integrated into the story and help give the predictable tale some extra Kung Fu kick. The architecture of most of the setting breathes new life to the typical cityscapes that have been made famous in Marvel, and the legends of the Ten rings scream of the Asian mythology that is seeped int heir history. I loved how well these things were merged into a Marvel tale, and though again a little predictable and flaunting, really elevated the origin story to stand out from so many others.

The CGI Finally Disney has invested in making their movies show off what the studio can do. Shan Chi and the bunch have plenty of amazing things to overuse the computer effects that the modern era loves. Special effects for the action scenes has more realism to it then Black Widow executed, the creatures you will see have a lot more polish and fluidity to their movements, and the special effects involving the ten rings are fluid and holding depth that I felt has been missing in some recent Marvel projects.

The Acting: A great part played by all members on this film, extras included, Shang Chi's cast shows that acting is not dead and characters can be utilized well. Simu Liu as the lead was fantastic, and his campaign for being in this movie could not have ended up with better results. He holds much of the prodigal martial artist, disciplined and focused to be an avid fighter capable of crushing his enemies with his style. However, he also has that troubled layer in the past to watch that helped spread his emotional spectrum. Awkwafina is still the same cooky role she always plays, but this time gets a little more balance and heroism compared to the other characters she has heralded as in the past. I loved how well she was used in this film, and how great she complemented Simu in this role. Leung brings a lot of pizazz to the character, once again giving us an antagonist with so much more than the scowl and fist, and I felt was a perfect casting to play the opponent of Shang Chi. So many other great actors and actresses in this film, but due to time restrictions I have to move on, but trust me they did well in their performances.

The Comedy: Awkwafina is often used too much for making us laugh, and Disney has struggled with forcing a lot of comedy to make it kid friendly. However, Shang Chi has taken some steps back into discipline and used the comedy well to break up the ice. Dialogue goes a long way to breaking in the laughs, with well-timed jokes and gags being the solid punch to the gut with comedy. There are several ridiculous inclusions in this film that at first seem out of place, but then roll back in to be an extravagant joke that had great set up. And the throw in references that come with it and you get a shining beacon of awesomeness that comes with this movie. It's all done so well and I was very happy with the results.

The Action: My bread and butter for most of the Marvel movies, Shang Chi delivered very well on this film's action exposé. The art of choreographed battles brings another homage to Asian culture, and with it fantastic fights that had more bite and impressive skill use then half of the Marvel cinema. It's exciting, it's dynamic, and most of the fights have a different feel to them than what you might expect. Used well in the story, there is purpose behind the inclusion of the battles and each one has a different meaning and stakes behind it than simply punching and kicking. Even more so, the strategies behind them and what is required to win, accomplishes a level of storytelling that has been lost in the modern era, so well done on that too.

A Bit More Adult: The movie is definitely showing Marvel's modernization into the 21st century, and takes a risk of making this film darker and more adult than other installments. Cursing is definitely increased in this one, with plenty of swear words filling the dialogue, but not to the point of being overdone. No F bombs, but some of the language has got a little more bite, so caution. In addition, the tone of the tale is darker, and the sunshine and rainbows of Thor, Captain America, and Guardians is left in the dust for a grittier tale, which again is a plus.

Some of the political moments: While nowhere as bad as 75% of movies today, Shang Chi does sometimes get a bit preachy with the agenda politics of the film. Taking time out to rub it in our faces with an obvious line stating, ""Look what I had to do,"" was a bit of showboating that I could have done without. Yet even this dislike is marginal, given it's very little occurring, has some nice moments that build off of it, and sometimes has a fun lesson or joke built in.

A Little More Action:

The action in this movie is great, and I loved how much of it flowed and accomplished what I was expecting of the film, and things I was not expecting. Yet there were times where a moment of fighting felt a little forced, namely the chase scenes with vehicles that seemed like an afterthought. However, the fights at the end needed some more time for me, and perhaps a little more bouncing between the battles occurring at the same time. Star Wars has done this successfully in the past, showing all manners of battling and giving you a big scope of the battle. Shang Chi has done this better than several of the Marvel films, but still had some room to give us more looks at the other characters kicking butt. The battle is lengthy enough, I'll agree to that, but a little more showing off of the other warriors would have rounded this fight to perfection for me.

The VERDICT:

Shang Chi finally made me feel like we were back into the realm of Marvel I fell in love with years ago. A cultural building world with both origin and story continuation, this hero's quest had all the makings of a fun, exciting and swift adventure we were expecting. Buried beneath the amazing fights and special effects, was a deeper movie than I had expected, using their characters well and integrating them to serve a purpose. Balanced comedy with a cultural inclusion and politics did not steal away from the main theme of the movie, and giving it that adult touch was a plus in my book, though again caution with your little ones watching it. As for limitations, I agree there is predictability and familiarity with the movie, but the fresh twist and balance helps rejuvenate the formula and add minimize the impact of the limitations for me. Though I will say a little better wider scope battle is still needed by them. Overall, my scores for this film are:

Action/Adventure/Fantasy: 9.0-9.5 Movie Overall: 8.5-9.0.","Likes

The cast gets ample time to give us their backstories, piece together all the cluse of this dynamic drama puzzle, and not sacrifice on the action to come.

Character Development: The trailers may have you thinking this is a modern martial arts film, and in a sense they would be right. However, the movie takes it one step further and goes beyond the punches to instead give the characters some soul and layers compared to the legendary films of the past. Shang's life is complicated and torn between light and dark, his sister as well experiencing the drama in her own manner that parallels the main protagonist. Even the antagonist has layers far beyond what we normally get from the Marvel group, and I loved how well their lines mixed together to make this melodramatic family story fit naturally into the Marvel universe.

The Surprise Cameo: Can't say much without spoiling, but if you are like me, then you will not be disappointed who shows up in the film. Several questions are answered with this character's return and with it many laughs to be had in the manner very familiar to Marvel fans. The inclusion of this character also holds an important (albeit stretch) plot element to give a little more meaning behind it, and I loved the choices they made to include him in the big picture.

The Cultural Influence: Like Black Panther and the African Culture, Shang Chi integrates so much of the cultural values of the Asian provinces into this movie. The costumes are stunning takes on the traditional attire, bringing the past to light while also sewing in some modern styles to jazz up the outfits. Concepts of family honor, the customs to practicing Marshal Arts, and the honoring of family are well-integrated into the story and help give the predictable tale some extra Kung Fu kick. The architecture of most of the setting breathes new life to the typical cityscapes that have been made famous in Marvel, and the legends of the Ten rings scream of the Asian mythology that is seeped int heir history. I loved how well these things were merged into a Marvel tale, and though again a little predictable and flaunting, really elevated the origin story to stand out from so many others.

The CGI Finally Disney has invested in making their movies show off what the studio can do. Shan Chi and the bunch have plenty of amazing things to overuse the computer effects that the modern era loves. Special effects for the action scenes has more realism to it then Black Widow executed, the creatures you will see have a lot more polish and fluidity to their movements, and the special effects involving the ten rings are fluid and holding depth that I felt has been missing in some recent Marvel projects.

The Acting: A great part played by all members on this film, extras included, Shang Chi's cast shows that acting is not dead and characters can be utilized well. Simu Liu as the lead was fantastic, and his campaign for being in this movie could not have ended up with better results. He holds much of the prodigal martial artist, disciplined and focused to be an avid fighter capable of crushing his enemies with his style. However, he also has that troubled layer in the past to watch that helped spread his emotional spectrum. Awkwafina is still the same cooky role she always plays, but this time gets a little more balance and heroism compared to the other characters she has heralded as in the past. I loved how well she was used in this film, and how great she complemented Simu in this role. Leung brings a lot of pizazz to the character, once again giving us an antagonist with so much more than the scowl and fist, and I felt was a perfect casting to play the opponent of Shang Chi. So many other great actors and actresses in this film, but due to time restrictions I have to move on, but trust me they did well in their performances.

The Comedy: Awkwafina is often used too much for making us laugh, and Disney has struggled with forcing a lot of comedy to make it kid friendly. However, Shang Chi has taken some steps back into discipline and used the comedy well to break up the ice. Dialogue goes a long way to breaking in the laughs, with well-timed jokes and gags being the solid punch to the gut with comedy. There are several ridiculous inclusions in this film that at first seem out of place, but then roll back in to be an extravagant joke that had great set up. And the throw in references that come with it and you get a shining beacon of awesomeness that comes with this movie. It's all done so well and I was very happy with the results.

The Action: My bread and butter for most of the Marvel movies, Shang Chi delivered very well on this film's action exposé. The art of choreographed battles brings another homage to Asian culture, and with it fantastic fights that had more bite and impressive skill use then half of the Marvel cinema. It's exciting, it's dynamic, and most of the fights have a different feel to them than what you might expect. Used well in the story, there is purpose behind the inclusion of the battles and each one has a different meaning and stakes behind it than simply punching and kicking. Even more so, the strategies behind them and what is required to win, accomplishes a level of storytelling that has been lost in the modern era, so well done on that too.

A Bit More Adult: The movie is definitely showing Marvel's modernization into the 21st century, and takes a risk of making this film darker and more adult than other installments. Cursing is definitely increased in this one, with plenty of swear words filling the dialogue, but not to the point of being overdone. No F bombs, but some of the language has got a little more bite, so caution. In addition, the tone of the tale is darker, and the sunshine and rainbows of Thor, Captain America, and Guardians is left in the dust for a grittier tale, which again is a plus.

Some of the political moments: While nowhere as bad as 75% of movies today, Shang Chi does sometimes get a bit preachy with the agenda politics of the film. Taking time out to rub it in our faces with an obvious line stating, ""Look what I had to do,"" was a bit of showboating that I could have done without. Yet even this dislike is marginal, given it's very little occurring, has some nice moments that build off of it, and sometimes has a fun lesson or joke built in.

A Little More Action:

The action in this movie is great, and I loved how much of it flowed and accomplished what I was expecting of the film, and things I was not expecting. Yet there were times where a moment of fighting felt a little forced, namely the chase scenes with vehicles that seemed like an afterthought. However, the fights at the end needed some more time for me, and perhaps a little more bouncing between the battles occurring at the same time. Star Wars has done this successfully in the past, showing all manners of battling and giving you a big scope of the battle. Shang Chi has done this better than several of the Marvel films, but still had some room to give us more looks at the other characters kicking butt. The battle is lengthy enough, I'll agree to that, but a little more showing off of the other warriors would have rounded this fight to perfection for me.

The VERDICT:

Shang Chi finally made me feel like we were back into the realm of Marvel I fell in love with years ago. A cultural building world with both origin and story continuation, this hero's quest had all the makings of a fun, exciting and swift adventure we were expecting. Buried beneath the amazing fights and special effects, was a deeper movie than I had expected, using their characters well and integrating them to serve a purpose. Balanced comedy with a cultural inclusion and politics did not steal away from the main theme of the movie, and giving it that adult touch was a plus in my book, though again caution with your little ones watching it. As for limitations, I agree there is predictability and familiarity with the movie, but the fresh twist and balance helps rejuvenate the formula and add minimize the impact of the limitations for me. Though I will say a little better wider scope battle is still needed by them. Overall, my scores for this film are:

Action/Adventure/Fantasy: 9.0-9.5 Movie Overall: 8.5-9.0."

193,193,Most Mystical and Beautiful Movie In History!,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is the most mystical and beautiful movie in history! The music, the special effects and the acting all take you to another world. The film leaves you wanting a Morris of your own.

The storyline follows a young man named Shang-Chi (Simu Liu). His father is a one thousand-year-old man and conqueror nicknamed The Mandarin (Tony Leung Chiu-wai), who has only ever used the infamous and all-powerful Ten Rings for evil. When the Mandarin is set to unleash infinite evil on the universe, Shang-Chi has to stop his father.

This movie is a cinematic experience. The fighting and choreography are out of this world. The long slow motion shots make the audience feel as if they are in a video game. Simu steals the show; every fight scene is flawless with his fluid movements and it proves just how hard he worked on his character for this film. Every audience falls in love with Shang-Chi; he's funny, with perfect comedic timing and he knows the balance between peace and violence. He encapsulates what the majority of young adults feel - like not being able to find their place in the world. The movie makes fans feel as if they've known Shang for years. It has wonderful flashbacks, which give the audience glimpses of his past, his pain and how his fears have shaped who he is. The film gives a wonderful all-around scope of this character that feels like a friend we've known all our life. It makes fans excited to see Shang-Chi again. Shang and his sister Xu Xialing are an iconic duo. They're both powerful and, while there's some tension due to their past, they put everything aside and let love shine through. Xialing is a role model, officially joining the Marvel Cinematic Universe's most powerful women. Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is perfect for AAPI (Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders) representation in cinema. It represents Chinese culture powerfully, shows what it's like to be an Asian-American in modern day USA, not to mention that Simu is Marvel Studios' first Asian-American superhero. Simu and Shang-Chi are writing history while also inspiring children and fans all around the world. The film delivers on all grounds; the cameos are shocking and leave you on the edge of your seat. Trying not to shout during the two post credits scenes prove to be a challenge. By the end of the movie, I wanted to sing the song ""Hotel California"" at the top of my lungs.

This film reminds you to search for who you are and let your past guide you to who you want to be. Ever since his mother died, Shang has been trained by his father to use violence. When he arrives at his mother's village, he learns how to find peace within himself and the world around him. He learns to trust himself and to use the rings for good.

I give Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 10 to 18 plus adults. It is available only in theaters September 3, 2021.

196,196,"More movies like this, please, Marvel","Thought I was feeling some Marvel fatigue after WandaVision (which started strong but ended on a bit of a whimper) and Black Widow (which wasn't terrible, but two months later I can't remember anything about it except how Florence Pugh was cool in it), but this one has rejuvenated some of my enthusiasm for the unstoppably huge MCU.

There's a satisfying origin story here, with a few small appearances from familiar characters that add spice to a host of new characters who are all quite compelling right out of the gate.

The action's great, and there's also so much of it- I liked how lots of the action felt relatively grounded by MCU standards, with neat stunt work and exciting camerawork making the action pop (it's only the final battle that gets really CGI heavy).

The humour's also more consistent than most Marvel films, with most of the jokes landing. Also cool were all the fantasy elements and creatures- they were all pretty inventive and well-executed.

I will say the one notable flaw is that there's a lot of exposition in the film's second half, but they get around that a little by having great actors like Tony Leung and Michelle Yeoh do most of the explaining (and there is a lot to explain, with this being a whole new side of the MCU and all), so it's not super noticeable.","Thought I was feeling some Marvel fatigue after WandaVision (which started strong but ended on a bit of a whimper) and Black Widow (which wasn't terrible, but two months later I can't remember anything about it except how Florence Pugh was cool in it), but this one has rejuvenated some of my enthusiasm for the unstoppably huge MCU.

I've read the criticism that the storytelling was choppy, but I didn't find it so. For me it was more like chapters in a book, completely working together to create a world of content and design.

That particular film was such a perfect finale for the series that I have struggled with the efforts to get the storyline going again. It doesn't help that they have been so scattered in topics, lacking a single core group to bring them all together. Shang-Chi is another random hero that I only knew vaguely from references in the comics, but I never read any of his books back when I was a collector. I appreciated that this film brought a new style to a MCU movie. The blending of Wuxia into a superhero story was a fun choice.

There were also quite a few great actors in this film including Tony Leung, Ben Kingsley, Michelle Yeoh, and I'd even include Awkwafina in that category. I can certainly see how some other people might struggle with Awkwafina's schtick, but I find her comedic timing to be great, and I was laughing along the whole time. However, the one major name I left out of the ""great actors"" is Simu Liu. Sadly, I found him a little bland. He was okay with the comedy, but I certainly don't see him stacking up with the legends that have come before in the MCU. Heck, Benedict Wong has only about 5 minutes of screentime in this film, but still made a greater impression on me than Simu Liu.

Digging into the story of Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, I'd say it's a fine origin story, even if it was highly predictable. This is the kind of movie where you can stay 10 steps ahead of it, and that is unfortunate. I think that's the biggest problem with the entire film, while it's fun and engaging it also feels like a rough carbon copy of things that came before. It's a movie that is emulating a number of Wuxia films from the past, but it's not as good as any of them. It's a movie that is following the tropes of a superhero origin story, and once again isn't on the level of the best of the genre. You can't fault their ambition, but their execution was lacking.

All that negativity is not to say that Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is a bad film. In fact, I enjoyed the entire time in the theater, and was genuinely invested in the story. I thought it handled the links to the MCU well, but without feeling like it had shameless pandering for the fans, or devolving into obscure references only people like myself would understand. The film had some gorgeous visuals, and created its own world in a way that managed to be both unique but still consistent with the style of other MCU movies. There were personal stakes in the film, despite the fact that the ending fell into a giant CGI battle that felt unnecessary.

Marvels new Shang-Chi was a choreographed dance movie disguised as Kung fu with slow paced action scenes and subtle but detailed components that pull a story together a satisfying but inappropriately fast paced manner. Making the writing seem more lazy and poorly thought out, which for me took away greatly from that satisfaction.

The main gripe I have with Shang Chi is how it just so happens that the Jade neckaces show the path and time to the hidden forest path just days before another oath opens for them to go find the tao lao.

Although the comedy music, and some of the choreography for the fight scenes were good enough to give this movie a final score of 6 out of 10 score.","Review By Kamal K

Although the comedy music, and some of the choreography for the fight scenes were good enough to give this movie a final score of 6 out of 10 score."
204,204,Entertaining but still not 'old' MCU level,"I have to admit I've been pretty disappointed with every MCU movie since Endgame so I was pleasantly surprised by Shang-Chi, which I didn't really have high hopes for (the last Marvel martial arts based hero was Iron Fist, and that was a turd). This movie was very entertaining even if it had a pretty generic and predictable storyline, and special effects were fairly uneven (amazing 'MCU quality' along with pretty terrible early 2000s CGI). It's great to add more diversity with an Asian superhero but I hope they will make good use of him in future movies and not relegate him to secondary sidekick roles!","I have to admit I've been pretty disappointed with every MCU movie since Endgame so I was pleasantly surprised by Shang-Chi, which I didn't really have high hopes for (the last Marvel martial arts based hero was Iron Fist, and that was a turd).

205,205,Shang-Chi's father is probably one of the best Marvel villains,,
206,206,Entertaining,"It's an entertaining fantasy, action and adventure film. It has beautiful backdrops, settings, and costumes. The martial arts ballet and fighting has excellent choreography. The cinematography was colorful with strong compositions and it flowed well from action scenes to action scenes.

Awkwafina is funny and she provided the needed comedy relief. The story was a little busy for my taste but it still worked. The CGI was good but expected from a Marvel/Disney film.","It's an entertaining fantasy, action and adventure film. It has beautiful backdrops, settings, and costumes.

207,207,Questionable script (and Awkwafina is just the worst),"The characters are a bit incoherent and straight up contradict their own characterizations at times, because the plot needs them to do it. There are a bunch of unneeded ""deux-ex machina"" or conveniences because the writers trapped themselves into corners for no reason (that's what happens when you get the 2021 ""Mortal Kombat"", ""WW84"" and ""The Expendables"" writers).

Also, we have Awkwafina destroying every type of scene (dramatic; epic; and also the comedic ones) with one of the worst ""acting"" I've ever seen and a same type of joke (""awkward nonsense"") over and over, from start to finish, with a role ridiculously large for a dumb comic relief.

But... Liu is actually pretty good as a lead (and his character is potentially great), and the ""Shang-Chi world"" is beautiful and it has everything to be super fun to watch in the future...without Awkwafine and better writers.","The characters are a bit incoherent and straight up contradict their own characterizations at times, because the plot needs them to do it.

208,208,A standalone ret-con of previous MCU mistakes.,"With the end of the Infinity Saga in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, there is a lot of room for new franchises to fill in the gaps left by the likes of Iron Man and Captain America. However, this means lesser-known properties like Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (2021) get their chance to shine. And while lesser-known franchises like Guardians of the Galaxy are now household names, I think it remains to be seen if Shang-Chi can truly develop its own integrated identity within the MCU.

Having somewhat botched the introduction of the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) in Iron Man 3 (2013), Shang-Chi attempts to ret-con this by insisting that the Ten Rings organization is a genuine threat to world peace. However, Marvel wants to have its cake and eat it too by including the ""Mandarin"" in this film. There are a few other loose connections to the larger MCU in this film, but they are more cameo call-outs than anything significant. Overall, Shang-Chi is its own story.

The fact that a good portion of this film's climax takes place in a mythical hidden kingdom made it feel disconnected from the MCU as a whole. Sure, other franchises within the MCU have their origin stories. Still, I felt they made it clear how they contributed to the ""whole"" of the larger arc by either introducing characters or concepts in prior MCU movies. Shang-Chi excels in its action and choreography but feels generic in the grand scheme of things as a standalone film. I'd almost wager that its sequel will be much more interesting and that those not already committed to the MCU can probably give this one a pass.

A standalone ret-con of previous MCU mistakes, I give Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings 3.0 stars out of 5.","With the end of the Infinity Saga in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, there is a lot of room for new franchises to fill in the gaps left by the likes of Iron Man and Captain America.

209,209,See Shang-Chi on the Big Screen,"The new Marvel Super Hero film, SHANG-CHI and the LEGEND OF THE TEN RINGS is the kind of film that deserves to be seen on the big screen and Writer/Director Destin Daniel Cretton (JUST MERCY) has crafted a film that earns that statement.

Based on the Marvel comic book character (of course), SHANG-CHI tells the tale of...well...Shang-Chi a financially struggling - but happy - Valet in San Francisco who has a family secret.

Writer/Director Cretton has crafted a whimsical, mythological, mystical and action packed film that settles in at the top end of the Marvel Cinematic Universe family of films.

At the center, newcomer Simu Liu (KIM'S CONVENIENCE) more than holds his own as the newest Super Hero in the MCU. He is grounded, centered and more sure than unsure as he discovers his abilities and his family's secrets. He is a worthy addition to this world of Superheroes.

Joining him is the remarkable Awkwafina (CRAZY, RICH ASIANS) as his best friend, sidekick who handles the drama comedy and action with aplomb. This film makes some smart choices with this character and Awkwafina shines.

The rest of the cast/characters are equally as strong from Tony Chi-Wai Leung (as Shang-Chi's father) to Meng'er Zhang (as Shang-Chi's sister) and good ol' Michelle Yeoh (as Shang-Chi's Aunt) bring strong characters to life. They all shine.

This film also brings back a character from a previous MCU film that somewhat redeems the poorly conceived character from his earlier appearance. I won't spoil it by saying who it is, but I liked what the MCU did with this character.

But, this being a Marvel movie, all of these performances anchor a bigger picture that is filled with action, action and more action - and something else, something mystical.

Here is where Director Cretton really shines. The action scenes are interestingly staged and choreographed well. The first fight (the bus fight that is shown in the trailer) and a fight on scaffolding both particularly work well.

This film does delve into the mystical in the last 1/3 and in Cretton's hands, this ends up working well instead of being comical or inane. I bought what was going on and was rooting for our heroes to defeat the undefeatable, fantastical creatures.

To be honest, the ""final battle"" didn't really live up to the rest of the film so that brings this film down a notch, but this movie did what it needed it to do, it opened up a whole new area of the Marvel Cinematic Universe - in both character and locations - and I am anxious to see where they go from here.

Try to see SHANG-CHI on the Big Screen, the visuals are worth it.

212,212,A Game Changer also its More Martial Arts Than Superhero,"Watched Shang-Chi And The Legend Of The Ten Rings with Simu Liu(Kim's Convenience) as Xu Shang-Chi/Shaun,Awkwafina(Crazy Rich Asians) as Katy ,Meng'er Zhang(The Street Dawn) as Xu Xialing,Michelle Yeoh(Crouching Tiger,Hidden Dragon) as Ying Nan, Florian Munteanu(Creed II) as Razor Fist ,Fala Chen(The Informer) as Ying Li,Benedict Wong(Avengers:Endgame) as Wong And Tony Leung(In The Mood For Love) as Wenwu/The Mandarin.

The Film is great if any of you are a fan of Martial Arts you are going to enjoy this also really dives into the spirituality of eastern mythos of the MCU while still have ties to the MCU Wenwu was responsible for the Ten Rings in the Iron Man films going back to the very beginning also love the father dynamic between Shang and The Mandarin great performances from Liu and Leung as well also Awkwafina continues to be on a role since Breaking out in Crazy Rich Asians and also starring in similar film in Raya And The Last Dragon This Is a Game changer also if your A Fan Forbidden Kingdom your are going love this ,This is Game Changer much like Doctor Strange in 2016. Im also grateful its helping Cinema return to form but im not against Hybrid releases though they help in certain areas also they both can Co-Exist.

This is Marvel at its best. A script (with Shakespearean undertones) that melds action with good character development and laugh-out-loud feelgood dialogue. The great thing is that you don't need to be a Marvel nerd to enjoy this one. Yes, there are some fabulous Easter Eggs for Marvel fans (and a wonderful return of a character from one of the early films). But its almost a standalone feature in its own right.


The action sequences are top-notch, particularly an early fight on a careering an Francisco ""bendy-bus"". Some great martial arts reminiscent of ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", made more exciting by the fact that the impressive Simu Liu did all his own stunts.






Negatives:






Timeline?: So, it took more of a Marvel nerd than I am (my wonderful daughter-in-law Bronwyn) to point out that although this film is set (largely) in the ""Present Day"", the events of ""Avengers: Endgame"" actually happen in 2023. So in the Marvel timeline, this is set in between Thanos's ""blip"" and ""the return"". This is the reason why Wong is present but not Doctor Strange, for example.

Summary Thoughts: Marvel goes East! This is a really entertaining addition to the franchise, mixing Marvel action with Eastern mysticism and martial arts. It's an impressive job by director and co-writer Destin Daniel Cretton, in only his second feature (he did ""Just Mercy"" in 2019).

As a Marvel film, there are of course end-credit scenes (""monkeys"" in onemannsmovies speak). A mid-title one is the best, bringing some additional Marvel characters into the mix. And there's a post-credits one which sets up for further sequels but which I found rather irritating.

It's ironic that a Marvel movie so right for the Chinese market - the first to be headlined by an Asian actor and with substantial Mandarin dialogue - might not get a release in China. According to this report, this appears to be for two reasons: firstly that the actor Simu Liu made some derogatory remarks about China in the past, and secondly that in the comics Shang Chi's father is Fu Manchu - a Western-derived character with racial overtones.

This doesn't seem to have hurt it so far. After less than two weeks of opening, it has made $262 million on a budget estimated to be $150-200 million.

221,221,One of the most Emotionally Charged Superhero Movies made in recent times.,"Let's keep aside all these serious conversations about Asian Representation, Diversity and all other societal stuff for a moment and let us all just appreciate Marvel for creating one of the most (if not the Most) emotionally charged superhero movies in recent times.

I'm not even exaggerating, I have been a follower of Marvel since my teenage days, suffice it to say, Through many ups and downs I keenly witnessed all of their works over the years. Trust me when I say that they have very much revamped their strategy this time around.

Excluding their typical set-up for a Comicbook blockbuster, Shang-Chi's familial/dramatic aspects are on an all-time high here. The way this story has been told, it just feels somewhat distinctive and special (Especially, compared to the last few projects Marvel has had come up with).

Other than the apparent masteries in its Audio-Visual departments (as expected); the narrative here infuses a powerful statement, a different outlook on family & self-acceptance. And guess what? It never sounded preachy nor pretentious; not for a single moment.

Another praiseworthy characteristic is the Action sequences or to be precise, all the Choreography behind! An incredible show for the Martial Arts fans and yeah FYI Simu Liu (Shang-Chi); our primary protagonist did most of his stunts, all by himself; that is amazing Isn't it?

Pretty much the same impression applies to all the other members of the ensemble; however, I do have some serious reservations about their respective character depictions.

To start with, Shang-Chi's estranged father (Played by a veteran, Tony Leung Chiu-wai); The writing on his character felt a bit detached and incoherent! Don't know about you, but for the most part, I was rather uncertain about what should I exactly feel about this guy! Should I be sympathetic or furious about the choices he had made? Gotta say this dilemma got the better of me.

Furthermore, the Mother of Shang-Chi (Played by Fala Chen) from Ta-Lo; I do feel her screentime in here should have been elongated a little bit more! Just so the viewers could grasp her part of the storyline too! Other than that, she, herself was pretty great in there. No complaints whatsoever. And Oh yeah, Nora Lum or Awkwafina (The Name, majority of you might know her by). She was terrific in her role as well; the much-needed comic relief in such a sob story!

In a nutshell, I must admit, this was a rather unprecedented gamble from Marvel and It did pay off quite well in the end. To be honest, I couldn't be more pleased about that! As I see it, these Superhero films tend to get repetitious over the years so it's always like a breath of fresh air whenever there is a drastic transition coming straight from the creators, and when it gets backed up by the Big Studios themselves; well that's your cherry on top.","Let's keep aside all these serious conversations about Asian Representation, Diversity and all other societal stuff for a moment and let us all just appreciate Marvel for creating one of the most (if not the Most) emotionally charged superhero movies in recent times.

Furthermore, the Mother of Shang-Chi (Played by Fala Chen) from Ta-Lo; I do feel her screentime in here should have been elongated a little bit more! Just so the viewers could grasp her part of the storyline too! Other than that, she, herself was pretty great in there. No complaints whatsoever. And Oh yeah, Nora Lum or Awkwafina (The Name, majority of you might know her by). She was terrific in her role as well; the much-needed comic relief in such a sob story!

In a nutshell, I must admit, this was a rather unprecedented gamble from Marvel and It did pay off quite well in the end. To be honest, I couldn't be more pleased about that! As I see it, these Superhero films tend to get repetitious over the years so it's always like a breath of fresh air whenever there is a drastic transition coming straight from the creators, and when it gets backed up by the Big Studios themselves; well that's your cherry on top."
222,222,What a pleasant surprise this was!,"Visually a perfect film for me watching a film in theatre after 20 months. Going in I expected marvel to half-ass the genre but still make it entertaining like a number of their other films. But I was taken aback wonderfully right from the beginning with the opening narration completely in Chinese. What I saw then was a proper modern wuxia fantasy which with some changes could've fooled me for a Chinese production (maybe I'm being a bit hyperbolic).

As fitting to a wuxia film, the lust for power, the love that conquers evil and the despair of lost love are all seen in this film. And who best to bring all those than the legendary Tony Leung who was the face of Hong Kong cinema through In The Mood For Love and acted in some of the best Wuxia films. He was definitely the best thing about the film. I was half expecting Marvel to mess it up like they use great actors for villains all the time. But he was the first main character to appear and even till the end his presence was felt.

This also has some of the best hand to hand action sequences in the MCU easily. The martial arts action, even when the superpowers are included also makes the action just beautiful which is something I feel the first time in an MCU film.

Awkwafina was quirky but what I liked there was that they kept it platonic and didn't jump into anything at any point. Maybe they'd do that in the future but at least they didn't break the flow in the relationship. Meng'er Zhang and Fala Chen also made their presence felt, as badass fighters. And Michelle Yeoh as expected of her came in and owned the screen when she was present.

I'm really surprised at how much I liked the film. The final fight sequences that rose to the most epic Chinese fantasy fight you can think of is the only thing I was expecting them to not mess up. Maybe it is because of my low expectations on how Marvel deals with the genre and the villain that made me love this so much.","Visually a perfect film for me watching a film in theatre after 20 months.

223,223,A Very Fresh MCU Entry,"When Iron Man hit theatres back in 2008, there were rumblings about a cinematic universe starting, but obviously, nobody expected that we would make it to a film like Avengers: Endgame at the time. Along the way, unknown properties like Guardians of the Galaxy and Ant-Man came out of nowhere as well but were welcomed with open arms. I was really hoping that Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings would follow in those footsteps, and it more than does. With rich world-building, a great cast, and the use of mythology, this is one of my favourite Marvel Cinematic Universe entries to date. Over time I may even come to appreciate it even more. After a first viewing, here's why Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings deserves to be seen on the big screen (if you can).

After being trained as an assassin by his father, Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) is given ten years of freedom from this life. In the present, the film picks up with Shang-Chi (Shaun) as he is living a normal life in San Francisco with his friend Katy (Awkwafina). When the history/mythology of the so-called Ten Rings is brought back into the forefront, his mission is to go and find his father. With the help of his friend and sister, they return home to face the music and it may just end up being father vs son to save this world. From start to finish, this film delves into the fun, the mythological, the family drama, and some incredible martial arts in order to tell this very solid story.

Aside from the fact that newcomer Simu Liu is undeniably charming and very likeable in this role, it's the unique style of the movie that made it stand out from the rest of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Yes, it still has the same look and feel, especially when it comes to aesthetics and comedic relief, but the rest of the film had its own distinct heartbeat. Bringing martial arts into this franchise just felt like a breath of fresh air to me. Not only does it feel simultaneous that they're trying to have fun and pay homage to classic films of this nature, but the fact that martial arts, mixed with actual god-like powers just felt so earned by the climax of the film. Without giving anything away, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is far more magical and mystical than I was expecting, but I kind of loved the finale when looking back on it.

There's really not much about this film that I feel compelled to complain about, but I will say that with as much drama that this film has and with how much it does dive into mythology, sometimes the comedy felt out of place. Awkwafina as Katy was great and I think her chemistry with Simu Liu was great as well, but I think certain cuts to her one-liners felt a little unnecessary for the specific situation. There are a few scenes where moments deserve our full attention, but the film felt the need to cut away to something funnier. Aside from the humour taking me out a few times, this film is just a blast.

Overall, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Tens Rings is easily at the top of the origin films that this franchise has given us and probably one of my favourite entries as a whole. Director Destin Daniel Cretton (Short Term 12, Just Mercy) has done a great job here and the cinematography by Bill Pope (The Matrix, Baby Driver) was also a real standout. I thought the scope of the movie felt very grand and that's absolutely in part to how it was filmed. I almost thought the finale of the movie was going to be a huge negative, but again, after thinking about the movie again, there is a nice progression in the story that makes the climax feel earned, even if a tad overblown. If you're a fan of this franchise, this one is a must-see, but even if you're not, this one can stand on its own as well, having only a few acknowledgements to previous films.

Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is now playing exclusively in theatres and if you're able to go in your area, I highly recommend it.","When Iron Man hit theatres back in 2008, there were rumblings about a cinematic universe starting, but obviously, nobody expected that we would make it to a film like Avengers: Endgame at the time.

224,224,Good,"One of the best origin MCU films. Good story, great and complex family relationships, with it's own identity, a very good balance between action and comedy and really good fight scenes. Between Simu Liu, Awkwafina and Tony Leung it's difficult to decide which was the best, but the acting was really strong all around (also a mention to Ben Kingsley, always funny!). The best thing I can say about it is that for most of it's duration it didn't even feel like an MCU film.

The negatives? Again, too much CGI. It's a huge problem with Marvel and Disney as they use the green screen in almost every scene. I like CGI but seriously, some scenes would look much better with practical effects, others would look way better if they just were shot at location.","One of the best origin MCU films.

229,229,Precious ... ten times,"Of course I am just riffing off, teasing and making fun of certain things with my summary line. Though there is some truth in there too - especially if you consider the last third of the movie - quite fantastical, pun intended.

But there is so much more here. And while you may have seen the bus scene already (I imagine many times), it still is quite the highlight and works wonders! Because there is even more to it than the trailer/teaser revealed! As is with the plot and the characters of the movie.

I was able to watch it on an Imax screen and let me tell you ... wow! But also wow and much respect to Marvel and Feige and anyone involved that they dared to make the first ten minutes or so in chinese! And throwing a lot of chinese terms (slang?) in there as well - throughout! That gives it a touch of authenticity. How immigrants in America or anywhere else in the world grew up. I do the same with my Greek and German/English.

It is also nice and while I am prone to be sarcastic, I really think it's a good thing to have such a major and big representation - especially nowadays with Anti-Asian hate/crime rising. All because of people blaming China and people of China for a virus ... the movie does not have that as a topic, it is entertainment after all, but in every promo and interview that the actors were involved it was something that was mentioned. Good for them and good for us, that this was made.

I am a bit biased when it comes to the MCU and this did get a pure theatrical release, instead of the Black Widow treatment (which also was available on Disney plus and the cinemas at the same time). So there is not issue when it comes to that. And if you can watch it on the big screen - you will not be dissapointed! Now waiting for the other stuff to drop ... especially after the mid credit scene, that is such a tease ... the after the credits scene might also hint at something, but the bigger tease was midway through the credits (actually almost at the beginning of them to be honest).

Sit back and enhoy the movie and the really funny characters ... and quite a few familiar faces. Some from the MCU and previous entries but also some from Asian cinema!

232,232,The best Marvel movie so far...,"Having seen the trailer for the 2021 Marvel action movie ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" I must admit that of course I was going to watch it, but I feared it would just be another run-of-the-mill-over-the-top-CGI-fest-but-barred-of-proper-contents Marvel movie. Yet, I opted to sit down and watch it, on the notion that it was a Marvel movie. But also because of the cast that starred in it.

And yeah, this movie was over the top in terms of CGI. Of course it was, because it is a Marvel movie after all. But luckily this movie broke the formula of the archetypical Marvel movie and this actually turned out to be the best Marvel movie so far. Well, at least in my opinion. Why? Well, because of the storyline and the fact that it mixed Asian culture and lore into the Marvel cinematic universe, and it was a much needed addition to an otherwise Western-focused series of movies.

The storyline told in ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"", as written by Dave Callaham, Destin Daniel Cretton and Andrew Lanham was certainly entertaining. And the movie didn't really have a dull moment, despite the fact that it was a movie that ran for 132 minutes. I thoroughly enjoyed the entire movie from beginning to end. And for me, this was a storyline with proper contents to it, that also included interesting characters and creatures.

Visually then ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" blew me away. The CGI team really worked their magic with this movie and brought it to life in a very visually fulfilling way. Lots of nice details and jaw-dropping special effects. And the creature designs in the movie were off the charts, I really enjoyed seeing those brought to life on the screen.

The character gallery in ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" was interesting, and that applies for both the villain and good guy side.

And they had such a great cast ensemble put together for ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"", with the likes of Asian cinema heavy weighters such as Tony Chiu-Wai Leung, Michelle Yeoh and Wah Yuen. But the movie was also nicely carried by Simu Liu, whom I was not familiar with prior to this movie. And also having Awkwafina in the movie was just brilliant, because she put on a spot on performance with her comedy sidekick character. And it was interesting and nice to see Ben Kingsley return to reprise his character of Trevor Slattery.

""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" is a good combination of action and narrative storytelling, which made for a very wholesome movie. And it should be said that the action sequences were breathtaking to behold, so very, very nicely choreographed and executed on the screen, taking that traditional Wuxia elements seen in Asian movies and mixing it in with the archetypical Marvel Western-based superhero movies.

I was more than genuinely entertained by ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" and it is certainly a movie that bolsters Marvel's hold for me, as their movies tend to be super flashy with spectacular effects, but rather hollow in terms of proper entertainment and storytelling.

My rating of ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" lands on a well-deserved nine out of ten stars.

235,235,Indeed legendary,"It's been ten years since Shang-Chi(Liu, charming, stoic) last saw his father, and leader of the criminal empire The Ten Rings, Wenwu(Leung, charismatic enough that we feel a lot of empathy for him, even when he does terrible things that we desperately want him to stop doing). That was also when he last spent time with his sister, Xialing(Zhang, a badass who deserves more screen time. Honestly, I'd be very surprised if she didn't, in future projects). He's joined by his friend Katy(Awkwafina, quirky, providing a lot of comic relief, something I'm told she's in general adept at), for what can best be described as a tense reunion, which allows the movie to really mine the family melodrama, one of the best elements it has. I won't give away exactly what the antagonist intends to do, only that our hero has to stop him. However, he has to figure out how, maybe even if, that is even possible.

Not quite, yet almost ""Black Panther for Asian audiences"", this does a lot for representation(including for women. Some of the best characters in this are female. In addition to the two that I've already mentioned, there is also Ying Nan(Yeoh, wise)), it is positively drenched in Chinese culture(the third act, while in ways it feels like it belongs to a completely different film than the first two, takes an especially deep dive into that. Ultimately, it is presented through a Western lens, and clearly we need to go further in this direction, still, it is a big deal that they put so much of it in an estimated $150 to 200 million major blockbuster, which will be seen by millions of people who would never consider watching an art picture, especially one focusing on a group they don't belong to), to the point where countless times, when it makes sense, major characters in this speak Mandarin to each other, rather than English, which it is subtitled into. And ""don't worry"", for those who think that the following is important: there are white people on screen, and they aren't made out to be ""less than"".

The action(each sequence of which feels distinct, belongs with the rest, and is memorable) pays tribute to many different kinds of martial arts films, acknowledging that they are standing on the shoulders of giants. Jackie Chan, wuxia, etc. The choreography is matched in skill by the cinematography. Not only are we seeing incredible fighting, the camera is dynamic, celebrating and highlighting how incredible it is. That *is* why you hire Bill Pope, the director of photography on the Matrix trilogy, two of Sam Raimi's Spider-Man entries, Darkman and Team America. The special effects are excellent. There are some issues with pacing, and certainly a chunk of this is composed almost entirely of flashbacks.

This features relatively brief but highly concentrated, surprisingly graphic gore(you know, there was a time when the fact that it's happening to beings that clearly are not human, wasn't enough to get away with this kind of thing with a PG-13 rating. Pepperidge Farm remembers), as well as a little strong language. I recommend this to any fan of comic book movie adaptations, and people passionate about diversity hiring. 8/10.","It's been ten years since Shang-Chi(Liu, charming, stoic) last saw his father, and leader of the criminal empire The Ten Rings, Wenwu(Leung, charismatic enough that we feel a lot of empathy for him, even when he does terrible things that we desperately want him to stop doing).

237,237,"Visually stunning, looking forward to the next one","Without spoiling anything as this story stands by itself there's going to be a sequel and I really look forward to that. It was that good in my humble opinion. Visually it was just stunning, great CGI's, very well choreographed fighting scenes, and a story that was most entertaining to watch. Some might find it over the top but it's a Marvel so what do you expect? To me this is one of Marvels best movies yet if not the best. The acting was good as well, and that from the whole cast. I never heard of Shang-Chi before but from now he has one more fan. Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings won't disappoint a lot of people, unless you're just not into this genre of movies. A must see for the fans.","Without spoiling anything as this story stands by itself there's going to be a sequel and I really look forward to that. It was that good in my humble opinion. Visually it was just stunning, great CGI's, very well choreographed fighting scenes, and a story that was most entertaining to watch.

238,238,great start but the fictionary world didn't fit in for me,"Started like a mix between martial art and the marvel universe. I found it something special and liked it a lot just until the journey starts and another world opens. From there on we came into a fiction world with dragons and monsters.

It's there that this flick lost my attention towards the story. It takes a while before the action comes back in. But once the fights are on, the effects are really stunning.

Mixed feelings aboutthe result, not bada fter all but with the other world coming in, it lost some points in the rating for me.

Nevertheless, some funny parts here and there added and they worked out fine.

240,240,A Marvel for the whole family.,"""The US government was almost toppled by a pretender named after an orange."" Wenwu (Tony Leung)

This quote is typical of the light-hearted but also serious addition to the MCU that is Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings. Although Marvel has always been less serious than DC, this time it leaves Superman and Batman to cry in their capes. Sweet superhero Sean/Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) has more humanity than almost any other hero, and he uses his martial arts only when pressed.

The opening sequence on a bus (you can see the bad coming from other cinematic bus rides such as in Nobody) is rousing and entertaining. It has a fight sequence I laughed through because of its ballet-like composition but satisfying because it sets up character and motivation.

When things get heavy, and they do because Sean must confront and potentially kill his 1000-year-old mobster dad, Wenwu, Awkwafina's Katy, Sean's girlfriend, is there with amusing one-liners throughout the adventure, right down to a life-saving shot in the big ending battle scene.

Director Destin Daniel Cretton deftly orchestrates his fights and his characters' lines with the authority of a much more seasoned filmmaker. He never loses sight of the central motif-the affirmation of family primacy, so that the potential chaos of a giant cast and multiple plot strands hosts a unity glued by character and dialogue.

Shang-Chi is a Marvel for the whole family and especially the cinephiles curious how The Marvel Cinematic Universe can be so diverse, so entertaining, and so perfect a purveyor of our heroic fantasies.","""The US government was almost toppled by a pretender named after an orange.""

242,242,The legend of the ten Marvel movies a year for all eternity.,"'Shang-Chi And The Legend Of The Ten Rings (2021)' is, essentially, exactly what you expect it to be. Not only does it feel like a Marvel movie, it feels like a literal Disney movie as well. This is often detrimental to the overall affair, as the piece should have been much more unique than it ultimately is, and it makes for a much less interesting watch overall. However, the formula it follows has provided plenty of success in the past; this time is no exception. Its highs are where you'd expect them to be, as are its lows, and there is an undeniable sense of fun, albeit cookie-cutter fun, to be had. The film is an entertaining action adventure that follows a young man whose criminal father calls him and his sister back home in order to lay siege to the mystical village he believes is holding his wife, the protagonist's mother, hostage. The villain's motivation is a little underexplored yet entirely understandable. It comes from a believable emotional place and is more satisfying because of it. The relationship between the lead and his no-good dad isn't explored as much as it could be, though, and the flick generally has a bit of a theming issue. The piece tries to tie its events directly into the wants and needs of its lead characters, but it does so in an unsatisfyingly half-baked way and honestly would probably have been better if it played itself as more of a straightforward adventure ala most of the 'Mission: Impossible (1996-)' series. Still, the touches of character development are appreciated and each lead player is written to be as likeable as possible. This, combined with the amicable performances, means that you care about the heroes even though you don't have all that much reason to. This keeps you invested in their stories throughout. The highlight of the entire affair is, for sure, its action. For the most part, the picture stays towards the right end of the practical to CG spectrum. The fights are never exactly realistic, per se, but they're based on competent choreography and clean camerawork. They're, more often than not, really entertaining. Sadly, the flick inches closer and closer towards the wrong end of the aforementioned spectrum the longer it goes on. By the time it reaches its finale (which gives me major 'Fast And Furious Presents Hobbs And Shaw (2019)' vibes for some reason), it's clear that the balance it previously achieved is going to go out of the window. Sure enough, its climactic battle is an entirely computer-generated affair; it isn't all that compelling and goes directly against what made the movie so enjoyable to begin with. No matter how hard it tries to disguise it, it still ends with a big blue beam in the sky. Still, the finale isn't exactly bad. It's just annoyingly intangible and feels a little forced in, even (as do the rather cringe-worthy post-credits scenes). Ultimately, this is a generic yet entertaining experience. Its charming acting and exciting action are clearly its highlights, and its weakest aspects are still decent enough. It's a good movie. However, I can't deny that Marvel fatigue is becoming more and more pertinent in my mind. You know what you're going to get before you get it. Plus, the studio's insistence that it has to perforate every single outing with references to other, almost entirely irrelevant fare is really annoying. Although most of their movies are at least okay, I find myself not caring at all about them. That's sad, really, considering that the MCU has produced some genuinely great pictures in the past. 7/10.","'Shang-Chi And The Legend Of The Ten Rings (2021)' is, essentially, exactly what you expect it to be.

243,243,Fun martial arts action-comedy with some dragon ex machina,"After a flashback, this movie jumps to a couple of slackers, Shaun and Katy, with Shaun proving during a wild bus ride that he is much more than a car attendant. Soon they're on a globe hoping adventure with world-saving dimensions.

The martial arts choreography is terrific, from the opening forest fight through that fantastic bus bit to the final hand-to-hand battle (followed by the big special effects battle seemingly required in every Marvel film). Fights are funny and exciting and that final battle is truly suspenseful.

The cast is also excellent. Awkwafina is as funny as ever, Michelle Yeoh and Tony Leung bring all their seasoned expertise to their roles, and the actors are don't know are also first rate.

Although ... in the case of Simu Liu, who plays Shaun/Shang-Chi, I have no strong opinion. He's a pleasant every man who handles the action scenes well but seems less mythic hero than ""genial best friend of the main character."" With all the other talent on screen he doesn't manage to leave much of an impression, but on the bright side I don't object to him.

The story is fun, the movie does a good job of mixing humor, action, and tragical reminiscences the pace is terrific, and man there are some great fights.

244,244,my eyes couldn't handle the sheer awesomeness on the screen,"Watch this in IMAX!!!! The entire movie has an expanded aspect ratio. You're watching about 70% of the image on normal screens, plus on way smaller screens with worse speakers. I promise, it's worth it

WOWOWOWOWOW. This movie blew me away. I love it. A LOT. From beginning to end. Everything. I walked out of the movie so hyped, silent-screaming under my mask as i walked to the car. It's been a while since i walked out of a movie this happy. I have so much to say.

I love the MCU (a lot), but there are a few things that are frequently lacking. One of them is good fight scenes. They always have awesome action scenes, but specifically fight scenes are usually pretty good, only great in a few movies like civil war and winter soldier. And in general, fight scenes in American movies pale in comparison to Asian cinema (Ip man, The Raid Redemption, anything Jackie Chan).

The fight scenes in this movie.... how do i describe it... amazing martial arts that's fast but clear, filmed in creative and astonishing ways without a hint of shaky cam or quick cuts, against stunningly beautiful backdrops... phenomenal. And they continuously focus on the fights instead of cutting to a different scene after 10 seconds like i've noticed in the MCU.

This is BY FAR the best fighting in the MCU and it's not even close. Has to be up there with the John Wick series and Netflix's Daredevil as some of the best we've seen in America lately. I loved the first major fight scene so much that i was worried it would be the best one of the movie, far too early. Lol. I be stupid sometimes

Another frequent flaw in the MCU is lack of compelling villain. Nope. Awesome awesome awesome. That's all i'll say.

Another of my frequent complaints is that the musical scores, with some exceptions, don't stand out. I think they heard. They're on a good streak with the shows and Black Widow. It's not as amazing as the Loki score but i liked it. It felt unique to this new franchise.

Still so much more to say, need to go faster. This is one of the best, maybe THE best, story in the MCU, especially the way it's told. I loved all the characters, i loved all the casting choices, i loved the performances. There are scenes of dialogue that gave me goosebumps. All the emotional moments hit. All the callbacks hit. There isn't anything that didn't work for me. There's no such thing as a perfect movie, but mannnnnn.

Lmao i didn't mention the cinematography. Why would i wait this long? It's MESMERIZING. A lot. Throughout. It's candy for your eyes.

It's also nice to see well-written comedy with jokes relevant to the scene and characters, that feels organic. As opposed to the ""insert joke here"" method we've been seeing more of, especially in Far From Home.

What's the opposite of formulaic? That's this movie. I never knew what to expect next (helps that i didn't watch a single trailer, they ruin movies). Definitely doesn't feel like a typical MCU movie. It has it's own unique tone and feel and character.

Continuing what i said in my headline, i have this thing where i get goosebumps and start tearing up, not from an emotional moment, but from a scene being so incredible, especially action scenes. Don't know why it happens, don't know if it happens to other ppl. Maybe it's partly because i can't risk blinking. That happened in this movie numerous times. Like ""this is the coolest thing i've ever seen in my life."" hyperbole, but mannnnn

after endgame finished phase 3 (yes i know spider-man), i was so happy and satisfied with the MCU. But i wasn't sure they could ever recapture that magic again. I knew i would watch everything and it would probably mostly be awesome. But i wasn't expecting top-tier stuff any more. Lol. I be stupid sometimes. I am ecstatic to have that notion obliterated. As of now, this is a top 6 MCU movie for me. Wow

All in all, i adore this movie. You may wonder why i wouldn't give it a 10 after all this raving. 10s are super rare for me, only 13 of them, and i watch thousands of movies. Interstellar, inception, mad max fury road, etc. Movies that shouldn't even be called movies. My 9s are rare too, they are my favorite movies. 10s are my favorites of my favorites. Only superhero movies i've given 10s are dark knight, dark knight rises and civil war.

If you're still reading, wow you're awesome! I think this is my longest review other than Interstellar.

I'm still in such a good mood. I can't wait to watch it again, in IMAX. I want to wait a week so it feels fresher, but i might not be able to!

We get some absolutely amazing fight scenes which seem right out of a classic Chinese martial arts movie. My only complaint is that it is a bit too long. It's still amazing with gorgeous designs of the creatures. It truly is a unique film to have a mostly all-Asian cast in a superhero movie.

We get some absolutely amazing fight scenes which seem right out of a classic Chinese martial arts movie. My only complaint is that it is a bit too long. It's still amazing with gorgeous designs of the creatures. It truly is a unique film to have a mostly all-Asian cast in a superhero movie. I recall an interview when the actor said a lot of Chinese people are called Bruce Lee. That makes the documentary ""The Problem With Apu"" even more idiotic. ***1/2."

Of course it has its bad sides, but I like it anyway. Music was good. Acting wasn't bad. I was very curious about the history of the rings. I loved this character, also his sister was great. I would love to see more about Ten Rings. Anyway, the movie wasn't bad.

""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" (2021) is definitely one of my favorite Marvel movies. I loved fighting scenes - this is first ting what separated this movie from the bunch. Also i liked the story (i haven't read comics). Acting was good by everyone. Action scenes (and there are plenty of them) were simply amazing. This is a one spectacular looking movie.

Overall, superbly paced at running time 2 h 5 min this movie never dragged. Special effects were amazing, as well as technical stuff of this movie including terrific cinematography. ""Shang-Chi"" is a superbly entertaining popcorn escapism.","Greetings from Lithuania.

254,254,Shang Empty,"Sorry for the delay.

Here we go...

I'm not feeling this movie. It starts with promise but It lost me after Wong vs Abomb.

The fighting is exciting. The movie lacks excitement though. It's a plain dull movie.

It's about a Karate master and... yeah the movie lost me and I have know idea what it's about. This is the first mcu film that I lost interest for midway. Even Im3 wasn't so bad because I lost interest from the very beginning.

Gotg2, mcu Spiderman 1/2 and IM3 are still the worse in mcu. Shang Chi just joined the club.

A movie so full of emptiness that it makes an empty box jealous

I'm not sure how this is a 7. Fans and the average movie goer should also be held responsible for horrible movies.

This movie ain't a 7 even if you watched this movie as blind and drunk.

They tried to be funny by having Wong be rude by drinking the couple's drink at the end credit scene. That wasn't funny at all. Wizard or not.

Speaking of funny, I didn't laugh once. When I used to watch these movies in theatres, the audience often told me when I should have laughed. I watched it at home, therefore I didn't know my cue of when to laugh.

The mcu needs to chill with the daddy issue plot

THOR Loki daddy issue Black Panta daddy issues Stark Daddy issues Star lord Daddy issues Ultron daddy issues Nebula and Gamora daddy issues Shang daddy issue Wasp daddy issues Scott langs daughter Daddy issues

No one has mommy issues.

I have to admit that I had my doubts about this movie but I was proven very wrong since it's an amazing movie. It has a beautiful and very interesting plot that keeps you in tense through its whole duration consisted of plenty of action and nice CGIs. For one more time Marvel succeeded on creating a nice atmosphere and connecting the previous movies with this one with many Easter Eggs so, we expect more in the near future. The interpretation of Simu Liu who played as Shaun / Shang-Chi was simply outstanding and he made the difference. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Tony Chiu-Wai Leung's who played as Xu Wenwu, Michelle Yeoh's who played as Ying Nan, Meng'er Zhang's who played as Xialing and Awkwafina's who played as Katy. The comic relief role of Ben Kingsley as Trevor Slattery was a brilliant idea that also gave something different in the movie.

Shang-Chi and the legend of the Ten Rings is an awesome and exciting mcu film that brings the stunning world with the asian culture. I will say i enjoyed this more than the previous mcu film Black Widow. Shang Chi introduces a new mcu character played by Simu Liu. And Awkwafina which is also a fun addition. While they are being chased by an organization called ten rings. Lead by his father Tony Leung. While Shang Chi learns his abilities and the ten rings. Before his father is trying to use that power for a personal reason.

Great epic plot. Shang Chi and Katy (Awkwafina) enter a hidden world Ta Lao where there is magical mythical creatures. Is like a wow stunning moment when you first see Wakanda in Black Panther. The film does give an emotional story build up and a villain that can be relatable.

The cast ensemble is great. Simu Liu did great with the character along with Awkwafina as his friend. Meng'er Zhang, Michelle Yeoh, Benedict Wong, Florian Munteanu, and Tong Leung all did great.

The set designs and visual effects are stunning and great. Can be colorful at moments. The music score was good as well. The action sequences are great and exciting. Every set piece had an awesome martial arts choreography which was well shot with the cinematography. Director did a great job in capturing the action and fight sequences. Even with the epic climax of the dragon battle.

There are two mid and post credit scene which sets up for further films and has a fun nod to the mcu.

I will say Shang Chi is a great exciting addition and i found the film to be very fast moving. Action packed. And a great family conflict story that is emotionally driven.","5 out of 5 stars.

262,262,A Marvel-ous martial arts joy,"Showing no signs of slowing down hot off the heels of Black Widow, a raft of well-received Disney+ series and arriving not too far in front of the hotly anticipated The Eternals, Marvel continues to put in work that puts many other wheelhouses too shame, with the marital arts infused Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, yet another entry into the brands increasingly loaded catalogue of quality blockbuster releases.

It's hard to pinpoint exactly what Marvel keep doing to maintain the momentum that started all those years ago with 2008's Iron Man, it's absolutely correct when many say a lot of these origin stories and event pictures follow a very set formula from A to B, but with an ability to attract some of the best actors working in the industry today and handpicking a raft of some of the most exciting Hollywood filmmakers around, Marvel have once more struck gold with the incredibly fun and inventive Shang-Chi.

Quite possibly the most visually sumptuous Marvel film yet, sometimes feeling as if Marvel has meet with Ang Lee/Yimou Zhang and in my mind the Marvel film that features the best choregraphed action scenes yet from the spectacle heavy brand, Shang-Chi is a big screen blast that is freshly directed by the upcoming Destin Daniel Cretton who here has got his just rewards after his great debut Short Term 12 and the sadly undervalued The Glass Castle came before this big-budgeted ride.

Infusing his film with a great energy and charm that is enhanced by the work of leads Simu Liu (in a career launching turn) as our likable hero Shaun/Shang-Chi, Awkwafina (doing her usual but fun schtick) as Shaun's bestie Katy and Tony Leung as the unfortunate villain of the piece Xu Wenwu, Cretton has turned out to be the perfect choice to start off the cinematic journey of the fist swinging Shang-Chi and helps instill in his film some nice differences to what we've come to expect from comic book blockbusters of the modern era.

Most notably for the film is the exciting use of hand to hand combat that is delivered spectacularly in two stand out sequences on board a moving bus and then bettered alongside a high rise building in Macau, both these set pieces are easily some of the most noteworthy of any Marvel film yet while also benefiting the film other than its Asian infused eccentricities is the fun relationship between Shang-Chi and Katy than never bothers with adding extra baggage to add weight to their believable and fun friendship.

If there was a major drawback to Shang-Chi's many wins it is in an overdrawn finale, a major problem many have acknowledged previously when it comes to Marvel films, Cretton and his team can't quite stick the landing for Shang-Chi with it being a little too long in the tooth for its own good and slightly overblown and while it features some incredible imagery and technical wizardry, the films rip-roaring start and strong middle section gives way too something lesser.

Final Say -

Another huge win for Marvel who have here with the help of director Destin Daniel Cretton and his talented cast, created an instantly likable cinematic universe that provides the comic kings with one of their most unique and exciting playgrounds yet.

264,264,Yet another superb stand-alone superhero flick in MCEU's kitty.,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (2021) : Brief Review -

Yet another superb stand-alone superhero flick in MCEU's kitty. MCEU's new phase never looked so promising but their products are delivering Better than expected. That Spider Man flick in 2019, right after Endgame, changed many perceptions about Marvel's future and even though couple of their recent series like 'Wanda Vision' and 'Loki' couldn't emerge as clear winners, they have set a solid base for upcoming new stories. Shang-Chi is a new start by all means. Not only because it comes under new phase but mainly because it is a stand-alone film and with a new superhero who is more like using traditional combat methods along with ancient superpowers. When Captain America or Black Panther begun as Stand-alone films, they promised too much and thankfully fulfilled it. Shang-Chi does the same. It may not promise too much like Steve Rogers and Wakanda stories but the point where it ends surely gives us hints of new assembled version of superheroes in Multiverse. Shang-Chi, the master of unarmed weaponry-based Kung Fu, is forced to confront his past after being drawn into the Ten Rings organization. The film has major portion covered by Family values and hence, it may look predictable but does not bore at all. Yes, few scenes are outdated and too dramatic as if we are watching a Superhero Film made in 90s but let's just forget those weak points as Shang Chi has excelled in Visual spectacle. The screenplay could have been better in the second half when the big War was supposed to take place but it actually looks tiny one except for those two humongous dragons which might remind you of 'The Hobbit'. Performances by Simu Li, Awkwafina, Meng'er Zhang, Fala Chen, Florian Munteanu are fine according to less potential available for the roles. Actually, the humour and tone of these characters was great. They all looked normal people when they were not fighting and even though the film has ancient refrences, the character don't actually go too deep to become expressive. Director Destin Daniel Cretton seemed slightly off track in the beginning when he tries to humanise all the characters with that typically teenage humor but as the film goes ahead, he recovers from the childish entanglement. With super explosive climax he surely makes up for his mistakes, rather makes us forgive it. Overall, Shang Chi is another superb entertainer for Marvel Fanboys and even neutrals are gonna enjoy it.

265,265,This could've been great if it wasn't for the cheesy writing.,"The story was riddled with holes and plot issues. Since when does Awkwafina's pedestrian character all of a sudden get invited to become part of the MCU team? What's her super power... stupidity? Don't get me wrong, I love her, but her character was lazily written. Then there's the whole daddy issues dynamic - Shang is with him, then against, then with etc.. Then we have these ridiculous dragons fighting, where one scores some power crystals and becomes stronger! This is just infantile lazy writing. There was zero shock value or anything spectacular in the entire runtime, with tedious long middle acts and a bumbling third act. The jokes were cliched and not funny. The funniest parts were Ben Kingsley's character, (of whom was in this for what reasons??) and the ending to go Karaoke - which was the only time I actually cracked a chuckle. You'd think with three writers we'd have something cohesive and coherent. But instead of a Marvel superhero story, we got a Disney evil vs good with dragons thrown into the mix. It's as if they tried too hard to create the Asian version of Black Panther.

It's a shame, because the directing and cinematography were spot on, and great S/VFX - although a little overboard with the CGI i.e. Dragons. The martial arts choreography was outstanding (although again, overboard after the awesome bus scene), and the casting and performances were excellent, especially Leung, who pretty much carried the film on his shoulders. It's a 7/10 from me.","The story was riddled with holes and plot issues. Since when does Awkwafina's pedestrian character all of a sudden get invited to become part of the MCU team?

266,266,8 Rings out of 10,"For the first time in a couple of years, since 2019's ""Captain Marvel"" the MCU introduces us to a brand new hero. Simu Liu who, rather impressively, first asked for the role on Twitter brings us Shang-Chi in a film that perhaps does have some issues with it's ending, but ultimately is a fun, funny ride of the type Marvel have been perfecting for the last 13 years.

Talented, but somewhat aimless, Shaun (Simu Liu) lives in San Francisco working as a valet with his friend Katy (Awkwafina). When he's attacked on a bus, he's forced back into the world of his father, a ruthless terrorist Xu Wenwu (Tony Chiu-Wai Leung). First visiting his sister, then returning to the Ten Rings compound, Shang-Chi decides to use his skills to defend his late mothers sacred homeland against invasion from his father and for control of ten mystical arm rings, weapons that grant their owner immortality and unearthly power.

If ""Black Widow"" was considered a wobble for the MCU, despite the fact I thought that it's a perfectly fine film, then it was important to come back with something that was undeniably excellent. ""Shang-Chi"" was that. It's the perfect balance of humour and action that Marvel have established over the last few years. The action too is tweaked slightly, to more closely resemble the types of Asian led action films that we've seen previously, be that the Jackie Chan style bus fight, or the ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon""-esque flashback fight between Shang Chi's parents. There's some lovely links to the wider MCU, including a return for Benedict Wong's Wong and for Trevor Slattery, Ben Kingsley's ""Iron Man 3"" character whose masquerading role as The Mandarin was one of the MCU's most divisive moments.

It's not perfect. The ending is perhaps a little rushed and lacking a moment or two of redemption earning for Xu Wenwu, but the peaks at the future for the character, and for the 10 Rings organisation is an interesting addition, plus our first real step on what might be the route to the next big bad. Excellent stuff.","For the first time in a couple of years, since 2019's ""Captain Marvel"" the MCU introduces us to a brand new hero. Simu Liu who, rather impressively, first asked for the role on Twitter brings us Shang-Chi in a film that perhaps does have some issues with it's ending, but ultimately is a fun, funny ride of the type Marvel have been perfecting for the last 13 years.

Talented, but somewhat aimless, Shaun (Simu Liu) lives in San Francisco working as a valet with his friend Katy (Awkwafina). When he's attacked on a bus, he's forced back into the world of his father, a ruthless terrorist Xu Wenwu (Tony Chiu-Wai Leung). First visiting his sister, then returning to the Ten Rings compound, Shang-Chi decides to use his skills to defend his late mothers sacred homeland against invasion from his father and for control of ten mystical arm rings, weapons that grant their owner immortality and unearthly power.

If ""Black Widow"" was considered a wobble for the MCU, despite the fact I thought that it's a perfectly fine film, then it was important to come back with something that was undeniably excellent. ""Shang-Chi"" was that. It's the perfect balance of humour and action that Marvel have established over the last few years. The action too is tweaked slightly, to more closely resemble the types of Asian led action films that we've seen previously, be that the Jackie Chan style bus fight, or the ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon""-esque flashback fight between Shang Chi's parents. There's some lovely links to the wider MCU, including a return for Benedict Wong's Wong and for Trevor Slattery, Ben Kingsley's ""Iron Man 3"" character whose masquerading role as The Mandarin was one of the MCU's most divisive moments.

It's not perfect. The ending is perhaps a little rushed and lacking a moment or two of redemption earning for Xu Wenwu, but the peaks at the future for the character, and for the 10 Rings organisation is an interesting addition, plus our first real step on what might be the route to the next big bad. Excellent stuff."

268,268,Finally a Chinese superhero film from Marvel,,
269,269,More of the same from the hyperactive Marvell/Disney CGI-verse,"Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) discovers that his all-powerful and millennium-old father is about to launch an attack against the magical village where Shang-Chi's mother was born in the likely mistaken belief that his wife is not dead but is rather being held captive (there is more to the plot than one sentence can sum up but what does it matter... the story is just scaffolding for the special effects). Much fighting ensues but fortunately everyone eventually learns how to 'get along' when faced with a real threat. You have seen it all before: physics-defying martial arts, monsters who look like the recently swallowed strings of LED Christmas lights, conflicted heroes with wise-cracking 'comic relief' sidekicks (an awful Aquafina and an even more awful Ben Kingsley), giant melees featuring a variety of glowing weapons (but no blood), hyper-kinetic and hyper-implausible car/motorcycle chases, and a lot of clichéd wisecracks, tough-guy dialogue, poseur slo-mo, and heroic vogueing (we're treated to the venerable three-point power landing/slide a number of times). The only novel thing the film has to offer is the excellent rendering of mythological beasts from Chinese culture; otherwise, it's an overly-long (132 minutes, which is 120 minutes too much Aquafina), derivative, repetitive, and ultimately boring entry in the bloated, jejune Micky Mouse-Marvel superhero franchise.","Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) discovers that his all-powerful and millennium-old father is about to launch an attack against the magical village where Shang-Chi's mother was born in the likely mistaken belief that his wife is not dead but is rather being held captive (there is more to the plot than one sentence can sum up but what does it matter... the story is just scaffolding for the special effects).

270,270,Promises good things for MCU's Phase Four,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings stars Simu Liu in the lead role alongside such heavy names as Tony Leung and Michelle Yeoh in this latest installment to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Liu's Shang-Chi must come to his own as the son of the legendary Mandarin (Leung), the owner of the Ten Rings.

I like this film's style most of all. Director Destin Daniel Cretton mixes Chinese wuxia settings and aesthetics with Hong Kong wire kung fu inspired action set pieces, while still keeping it feeling like a Marvel film. There's a surprising amount of callbacks and nods to the larger Marvel universe, pleasing dedicated fans, but the film is still able to stand on its own feet and introduce us to its hero.

Kudos also to the whole filming for these action scenes. Very little shaky cam or jump cuts, especially for the hand to hand scenes. Exactly as it should be. I'd dare to say that this film has some of, if not the best action set pieces in all of MCU.

One of the most thrilling and visually spectacular end battles as well, come to think of it.

Furthermore, the acting is solid, especially from Liu, Leung and Awkwafina, who plays Shang-Chi's American friend. Meng'er Zhang as Xialing, Shang-Chi's younger sister, was perhaps my only real gripe with the film. I could have used either a bit more edge to her or alternatively a lot less. Now she seemed to flipflop between relatable and aggravating.

All in all, not the best Marvel movie by any means, but that's a really high bar to clear. I can simply say that based on this, I'm very optimistic about MCU's continued future.","Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings stars Simu Liu in the lead role alongside such heavy names as Tony Leung and Michelle Yeoh in this latest installment to the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

271,271,The Master of kung fu was really good but not as good as I wanted it to be.,"It was better than the proceeding Marvel movie Black Window. More exceeding the expectations of a Marvel movie. Shang-Chi feels like the marvel movie experience is starting to get back to the normal of the theme ride Martian Scorsese believes they are (I can't disagree, just note that's what I want)

In comparison Shang-Chi is a lower level character. I am a fan of Marvel comics but got more of the references to the Marvel Cinematic Universe in this movie than to the direct comic book references. Those Marvel cinematic universe references were amazing enough to get over the fact that the obvious comic book ones went over my head. I mean this movie's connection to other movies is great fanfare that makes me love it more. So really cool cameos happen that actually move the story along.

I did like what they did with the Mandarin here but do feel they copied and paste a lot of things into the story of Shang-Chi to make a complete movie for a lower level character. From the little I know of the character he more fits into those Netflix's shows they did a few years back but change him enough to justify a blockbuster.

They did succeed in making Shang-Chi's background more fuller. The relationship between him and his father and sister was beautiful, complex and more importantly, never bored me and of course Awkafina as the comedy relief and best friend to Shang-Chi was strategic gold. The story for the background was not that full. It's really a character driven movie for without the amazing performances from a group of actors who know their stuff this story would fall short.

Note, I loved the fact that Michelle Yeoh was in this movie and that gives it a lot, but she's done way better in less effective films (but she most likely got a huge paycheck from Disney just to wave her hands around).

The special effects were good in this flick. I was impress with what was used to make the final conflict and I was convince that the dude from Kim's Convenience was a master of kung fu

Its a good movie but it did not live up to my high expectations of it. It gave me a lot of cool things but really did not give me anything I did not see before, in movies that did it better, but if it's about anything I did spend the rest of the day pretending I knew Kung fu.","It was better than the proceeding Marvel movie Black Window.

273,273,Finally a new kind of marvel story,,
274,274,An easy watch that fits into the MCU well,"A San Francisco valet finds his past catching up with him in spectacular fashion.

This is an entertaining superhero adventure story with an Asian martial arts theme and a number of entertaining scenes.

Like many introductions to superhero characters there is a bit of backstory to go through and this film does it with flashback sequences in a similar way to 'Black Panther'. These are mixed with the action, humour and unfolding narrative of the present day plot. Additionally there is some important exposition added relating to the Marvel multiverse. Personally I think everything depicted could have been done in more than one movie, and not so rushed, but that's just a personal preference. What is presented is not complicated in anyway, but very simplified, presumably so that it can be established quickly and the likes of Shang-Chi and Katy can share screens with other MCU characters as soon as possible.

The tone and general feel of the movie also reminds me of the approach taken with 'Black Panther', particularly when it focusses on a location that, like Wakanda, mixes the sights and sounds of regional culture with the sci-fi fantasy. It has obviously been written carefully so that it displays imagery associated with far-Eastern culture like martial arts, traditional costuming, rural settings, that is marketable to a Western audience, but at the same time it avoids other commonly associated negative stereotyping like exaggerated accents, sorcery, yellow peril, bad driving, and (thankfully) gong sounds. Much of this is drenched with a liberal amount of fast-talking contemporary American humour.

There are a number of highly enjoyable scenes such as the fight sequence on the bus, the various comedy moments, virtually everything that comes out of Ben Kingsley's mouth, and all the flashback scenes. The final dinner table scene is probably my favourite.

Visually as you can imagine it is beautiful and full of top drawer cinematography, editing, and technology-driven effects. For me though the spectacle goes over-the-top, particularly in the final action sequence.

Most actors are solid such as Simu Liu, Tony Leung, Meng'er Zhang, Michelle Yeoh, Fala Chen, and Benedict Wong. The standout performances for me easily are Nora Lum and Ben Kingsley who have buckets of charisma and the advantage of all the best lines.

Overall there is little to criticise, it just feels like what Martin Scorsese described perfectly in 2019 as a theme park rather than cinema.","A San Francisco valet finds his past catching up with him in spectacular fashion.

280,280,Marvel Sprinkles a Different Flavor into the MCU,"Marvel gets mystical in this mashup of the plucky, familiar MCU character and the more stoic, legend-heavy air of wuxia films. It's a fresh mix, effectively breaking the gravity of its more serious moments with a well-timed jape while lending credence and lore to a lesser-known corner of the comic kingdom, but these crossover moments sometimes test their limits. I could see more grounded viewers being turned off by the dragons and soul-sucking demons (far cry from the feasible reality of the first Iron Man, that) while serious fans of Chinese fantasy are bucked by the constant injection of loose wit and slappy one-liners.

When it's rolling, Shang Chi does manage to toe that line and deliver something appropriately new and versatile, a good reflection of both worlds. It benefits from a tight pair of central performances (Simu Liu and Awkwafina as a team of underachieving twenty-somethings) and several big, powerful action sets (the articulated bus fight might be one of the best combat scenes Marvel's ever put out) while tying in a dangling thread or two from earlier films to provide a sense of greater connection. On several occasions, however, it's guilty of being too self-indulgent and losing the narrative. It's great to see Ben Kingsley again, adding nuance to his part in Iron Man 3, but his scenes are the main offender here; excessive and distracting and way too cute.

The action is strong, the dialogue (mostly) works, the scenery looks great, but in the big picture, Shang Chi feels small-scale and disposable. Non-completionists won't miss anything crucial if they choose to skip it.","Marvel gets mystical in this mashup of the plucky, familiar MCU character and the more stoic, legend-heavy air of wuxia films.

283,283,Marvel movie by the numbers with beautiful dragons and charming locations,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is yet another movie inspired by the Marvel universe that has constantly been inspiring the cinematic world for more than a decade now. While the movie follows the usual stereotypes, it manages to stand out with its stunning special effects and locations.

The movie revolves around Shaun, a Chinese immigrant living in the United States of America who is working as a valet with his quirky friend and soulmate Katy. One day, they get attacked by a group of assassins on a bus and only just manage to survive. Shaun immediately understands that the attack must be related to his influential estranged father. Along with Katy, he decides to team up with his tough estranged sister Xialing to find out what's going on.

This film convinces on multiple levels. First of all, the acting performances are quite quirky and convincing. Especially the ladies steal the show. Awkwafina delivers the goods as curious, dynamic and funny woman that anyone would like to have as a friend. Zhang Meng'er on the other side represents a much darker character shaped by dramatic events from the past who is much more difficult to approach with her tough, relentless and independent personality.

The expensive special effects certainly deliver the goods as well. The scenes in a fantasy world, in Ancient China and in contemporary San Francisco are all equally stunning to watch. The fantastic creatures such as dragons look impressive on the big screen.

The story might be predictable but is nevertheless entertaining from start to finish thanks to steady pace and inspired execution. You will truly care about the fates of the different characters as you are watching this film.

However, this film isn't without its occasional flaws. First of all, lead actor Simu Liu simply doesn't have the charisma of the other actresses and actors involved. Casting him was a bold choice but it didn't fully pay off in my opinion.

Up next, the movie desperately tries to connect to other characters in the Marvel Universe. The appearance of Trevor Slattery played by Ben Kingsley is completely random as it only seems to be a pretext to offer some misplaced comic relief. The mid-credit scene starts in an amusing fashion but suddenly involving Bruce Banner and Carol Danvers only seems like a weak attempt to develop a hype for potential sequels. The same goes for yet another scene after the credits that evokes more questions rather than concluding the film appropriately.

At the end of the day, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is an entertaining fantasy action film of the Marvel Universe that should appeal to faithful and occasional fans alike. It's one of the better films in the franchise but perhaps Marvel should focus on quality over quantity instead of becoming a monstrous capitalistic machine that is scarier than any gigantic dragon shown in the film.","Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is yet another movie inspired by the Marvel universe that has constantly been inspiring the cinematic world for more than a decade now.

287,287,"A fun time at the movies, and that's all it really needed to be","Charming and incredibly fun- Shang-Chi may not be the best Marvel has had to offer- but it is one of their better films in some time. My main problems with the film lie in the films storyline, which to be honest, is really good, but incredibly all over the place editing wise and there is just so much of it that it feels like two movies could have been made out of it. I love that we get a more in depth look at our characters, their flaws, their regrets, the tragedy in their lives- but the editing makes it feel rather out of place at times- and takes away from the impact the film could have had and its heart. That being said, the film still manages to be very enjoyable throughout. The action scenes are absolutely incredible, the look of the film incredibly well developed- something very fresh and original for Marvel studios- and the cast are all a joy to watch- especially Simu Liu and Aquafina in the lead and supporting roles. I was skeptical of Aquafina being in a Marvel movie for sure, but she really helped the film as a whole, and honestly I would love to see more of her character in future Marvel projects. The film is entertaining, despite the pacing of the film being a bit all over the place at times. It has some brilliant, elaborate special effects that you will be gawking at on the screen, and plenty of surprises that will be bound to make you smile. In the end, Shang-Chi was a fun time for a Marvel movie- something most comic-book flicks have forgotten about recently- and i'm excited what this character has to offer in future films.

My Rating: 8.6/10.","Charming and incredibly fun- Shang-Chi may not be the best Marvel has had to offer- but it is one of their better films in some time.

288,288,Shang-Chi and NOT the Ten Rings -_-,"As someone that really enjoys the MCU, I'm starting to wonder if COVID may have killed it. Black Widow was a meh experience and now Shang-Chi feels like more of that rote, by the numbers repetitiveness. Yes, they add a lot of Asian elements here to bring in other groups and try and lessen the white dominance of this franchise and I appreciate that but this movie felt like it was rushing through the plot to get to the next fantastical element and in so doing really robbed those moments of any lingering significance. Not to mention, the Marvel formula felt so very pronounced. It's so obvious what's going to happen in this movie from the jump and that's disappointing.

That aside, I'm a moderate fan of older Marvel comics and... THESE AREN'T THE TEN RINGS! Normally I don't mind when the MCU makes little adjustments to the source material. Comics are weird and a lot of that stuff wouldn't translate well to film, I get that but so far they've had two big, fat whiffs on anything Mandarin related. Looking at you Iron Man 3. These things are just super generic bands with pretty underwhelming powers which is so different from the 10 rings in the comics that all do something different!

Nerd rage aside, this just felt average to me. I'll probably check it out at some point again but I'm not feeling any sort of draw to revisit it soon. It's a touch more disappointing as I work through the Disney+ Marvel shows which all feel more engaging and more creative than this. Come on, Mouse. Get it together and put some of this TV magic back on the big screen!","As someone that really enjoys the MCU, I'm starting to wonder if COVID may have killed it.

289,289,Incredible MCU origin story,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is an incredible MCU origin story that's epic, emotional and extremely thrilling whilst also connecting to the greater universe in fun and satisfying ways. It's definitely the best thing in phase 4 so far even if it's third act has some of the usual MCU problems.

Simu Liu gives an incredible and extremely charismatic lead performance whilst also having superb chemistry with Awkwafina, who is also incredible. Michelle Yeoh and Meng'er Zhang are both great and Tony Leung is amazing as one of the better villains in the MCU with plenty of backstory and depth.

Destin Daniel Cretton's direction is excellent, it's extremely well filmed and stylish with some of the best action sequences in the franchise. The fight choreography is extremely impressive and the CG is mostly strong. It's well paced and both the soundtrack and the music by Joel P.

Great Pacing: Shang Chi has a lot of things built into the tale as it tries to make an origin story fit so far into the movie series. With all the information, there might be worry of the pace being off, but surprisingly it is done super well. Never really dragging, but not moving a blinding pace (mostly), Shang Chi's combination tales keeps things moving but not flying over the important elements to connect with characters. The cast gets ample time to give us their backstories, piece together all the cluse of this dynamic drama puzzle, and not sacrifice on the action to come.

Character Development: The trailers may have you thinking this is a modern martial arts film, and in a sense they would be right. However, the movie takes it one step further and goes beyond the punches to instead give the characters some soul and layers compared to the legendary films of the past. Shang's life is complicated and torn between light and dark, his sister as well experiencing the drama in her own manner that parallels the main protagonist. Even the antagonist has layers far beyond what we normally get from the Marvel group, and I loved how well their lines mixed together to make this melodramatic family story fit naturally into the Marvel universe.

The Surprise Cameo: Can't say much without spoiling, but if you are like me, then you will not be disappointed who shows up in the film. Several questions are answered with this character's return and with it many laughs to be had in the manner very familiar to Marvel fans. The inclusion of this character also holds an important (albeit stretch) plot element to give a little more meaning behind it, and I loved the choices they made to include him in the big picture.

The Cultural Influence: Like Black Panther and the African Culture, Shang Chi integrates so much of the cultural values of the Asian provinces into this movie. The costumes are stunning takes on the traditional attire, bringing the past to light while also sewing in some modern styles to jazz up the outfits. Concepts of family honor, the customs to practicing Marshal Arts, and the honoring of family are well-integrated into the story and help give the predictable tale some extra Kung Fu kick. The architecture of most of the setting breathes new life to the typical cityscapes that have been made famous in Marvel, and the legends of the Ten rings scream of the Asian mythology that is seeped int heir history. I loved how well these things were merged into a Marvel tale, and though again a little predictable and flaunting, really elevated the origin story to stand out from so many others.

The CGI Finally Disney has invested in making their movies show off what the studio can do. Shan Chi and the bunch have plenty of amazing things to overuse the computer effects that the modern era loves. Special effects for the action scenes has more realism to it then Black Widow executed, the creatures you will see have a lot more polish and fluidity to their movements, and the special effects involving the ten rings are fluid and holding depth that I felt has been missing in some recent Marvel projects.

The Acting: A great part played by all members on this film, extras included, Shang Chi's cast shows that acting is not dead and characters can be utilized well. Simu Liu as the lead was fantastic, and his campaign for being in this movie could not have ended up with better results. He holds much of the prodigal martial artist, disciplined and focused to be an avid fighter capable of crushing his enemies with his style. However, he also has that troubled layer in the past to watch that helped spread his emotional spectrum. Awkwafina is still the same cooky role she always plays, but this time gets a little more balance and heroism compared to the other characters she has heralded as in the past. I loved how well she was used in this film, and how great she complemented Simu in this role. Leung brings a lot of pizazz to the character, once again giving us an antagonist with so much more than the scowl and fist, and I felt was a perfect casting to play the opponent of Shang Chi. So many other great actors and actresses in this film, but due to time restrictions I have to move on, but trust me they did well in their performances.

The Comedy: Awkwafina is often used too much for making us laugh, and Disney has struggled with forcing a lot of comedy to make it kid friendly. However, Shang Chi has taken some steps back into discipline and used the comedy well to break up the ice. Dialogue goes a long way to breaking in the laughs, with well-timed jokes and gags being the solid punch to the gut with comedy. There are several ridiculous inclusions in this film that at first seem out of place, but then roll back in to be an extravagant joke that had great set up. And the throw in references that come with it and you get a shining beacon of awesomeness that comes with this movie. It's all done so well and I was very happy with the results.

The Action: My bread and butter for most of the Marvel movies, Shang Chi delivered very well on this film's action exposé. The art of choreographed battles brings another homage to Asian culture, and with it fantastic fights that had more bite and impressive skill use then half of the Marvel cinema. It's exciting, it's dynamic, and most of the fights have a different feel to them than what you might expect. Used well in the story, there is purpose behind the inclusion of the battles and each one has a different meaning and stakes behind it than simply punching and kicking. Even more so, the strategies behind them and what is required to win, accomplishes a level of storytelling that has been lost in the modern era, so well done on that too.

A Bit More Adult: The movie is definitely showing Marvel's modernization into the 21st century, and takes a risk of making this film darker and more adult than other installments. Cursing is definitely increased in this one, with plenty of swear words filling the dialogue, but not to the point of being overdone. No F bombs, but some of the language has got a little more bite, so caution. In addition, the tone of the tale is darker, and the sunshine and rainbows of Thor, Captain America, and Guardians is left in the dust for a grittier tale, which again is a plus.

Some of the political moments: While nowhere as bad as 75% of movies today, Shang Chi does sometimes get a bit preachy with the agenda politics of the film. Taking time out to rub it in our faces with an obvious line stating, ""Look what I had to do,"" was a bit of showboating that I could have done without. Yet even this dislike is marginal, given it's very little occurring, has some nice moments that build off of it, and sometimes has a fun lesson or joke built in.

A Little More Action:

The action in this movie is great, and I loved how much of it flowed and accomplished what I was expecting of the film, and things I was not expecting. Yet there were times where a moment of fighting felt a little forced, namely the chase scenes with vehicles that seemed like an afterthought. However, the fights at the end needed some more time for me, and perhaps a little more bouncing between the battles occurring at the same time. Star Wars has done this successfully in the past, showing all manners of battling and giving you a big scope of the battle. Shang Chi has done this better than several of the Marvel films, but still had some room to give us more looks at the other characters kicking butt. The battle is lengthy enough, I'll agree to that, but a little more showing off of the other warriors would have rounded this fight to perfection for me.

The VERDICT:

Shang Chi finally made me feel like we were back into the realm of Marvel I fell in love with years ago. A cultural building world with both origin and story continuation, this hero's quest had all the makings of a fun, exciting and swift adventure we were expecting. Buried beneath the amazing fights and special effects, was a deeper movie than I had expected, using their characters well and integrating them to serve a purpose. Balanced comedy with a cultural inclusion and politics did not steal away from the main theme of the movie, and giving it that adult touch was a plus in my book, though again caution with your little ones watching it. As for limitations, I agree there is predictability and familiarity with the movie, but the fresh twist and balance helps rejuvenate the formula and add minimize the impact of the limitations for me. Though I will say a little better wider scope battle is still needed by them. Overall, my scores for this film are:

293,293,Most Mystical and Beautiful Movie In History!,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is the most mystical and beautiful movie in history! The music, the special effects and the acting all take you to another world. The film leaves you wanting a Morris of your own.

The storyline follows a young man named Shang-Chi (Simu Liu). His father is a one thousand-year-old man and conqueror nicknamed The Mandarin (Tony Leung Chiu-wai), who has only ever used the infamous and all-powerful Ten Rings for evil. When the Mandarin is set to unleash infinite evil on the universe, Shang-Chi has to stop his father.

This movie is a cinematic experience. The fighting and choreography are out of this world. The long slow motion shots make the audience feel as if they are in a video game. Simu steals the show; every fight scene is flawless with his fluid movements and it proves just how hard he worked on his character for this film. Every audience falls in love with Shang-Chi; he's funny, with perfect comedic timing and he knows the balance between peace and violence. He encapsulates what the majority of young adults feel - like not being able to find their place in the world. The movie makes fans feel as if they've known Shang for years. It has wonderful flashbacks, which give the audience glimpses of his past, his pain and how his fears have shaped who he is. The film gives a wonderful all-around scope of this character that feels like a friend we've known all our life. It makes fans excited to see Shang-Chi again. Shang and his sister Xu Xialing are an iconic duo. They're both powerful and, while there's some tension due to their past, they put everything aside and let love shine through. Xialing is a role model, officially joining the Marvel Cinematic Universe's most powerful women. Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is perfect for AAPI (Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders) representation in cinema. It represents Chinese culture powerfully, shows what it's like to be an Asian-American in modern day USA, not to mention that Simu is Marvel Studios' first Asian-American superhero. Simu and Shang-Chi are writing history while also inspiring children and fans all around the world. The film delivers on all grounds; the cameos are shocking and leave you on the edge of your seat. Trying not to shout during the two post credits scenes prove to be a challenge. By the end of the movie, I wanted to sing the song ""Hotel California"" at the top of my lungs.

This film reminds you to search for who you are and let your past guide you to who you want to be. Ever since his mother died, Shang has been trained by his father to use violence. When he arrives at his mother's village, he learns how to find peace within himself and the world around him. He learns to trust himself and to use the rings for good.

I saw this at the 3D 4DX at the O2 and we were thrown about, blown on, rained on and every other sensation at every turn it was fab-u-lus!

We had some great acting some great humour and plenty of ""magic"", for Marvel fans after the lacklustre Black Widow, the disaster of the Winter Soldier. Two goodens in a row what with Snake Eyes!

296,296,"More movies like this, please, Marvel","Thought I was feeling some Marvel fatigue after WandaVision (which started strong but ended on a bit of a whimper) and Black Widow (which wasn't terrible, but two months later I can't remember anything about it except how Florence Pugh was cool in it), but this one has rejuvenated some of my enthusiasm for the unstoppably huge MCU.

There's a satisfying origin story here, with a few small appearances from familiar characters that add spice to a host of new characters who are all quite compelling right out of the gate.

The action's great, and there's also so much of it- I liked how lots of the action felt relatively grounded by MCU standards, with neat stunt work and exciting camerawork making the action pop (it's only the final battle that gets really CGI heavy).

The humour's also more consistent than most Marvel films, with most of the jokes landing. Also cool were all the fantasy elements and creatures- they were all pretty inventive and well-executed.

I will say the one notable flaw is that there's a lot of exposition in the film's second half, but they get around that a little by having great actors like Tony Leung and Michelle Yeoh do most of the explaining (and there is a lot to explain, with this being a whole new side of the MCU and all), so it's not super noticeable.","Thought I was feeling some Marvel fatigue after WandaVision (which started strong but ended on a bit of a whimper) and Black Widow (which wasn't terrible, but two months later I can't remember anything about it except how Florence Pugh was cool in it), but this one has rejuvenated some of my enthusiasm for the unstoppably huge MCU.

The CGI and location shoots are breathtaking. The fighting is the best I've ever seen and even the training ground sequences have an exquisite grace. The action was balanced by heart.

I could go on raving but I'll conclude my feedback by saying that this is in every way as powerful a MCU solo representation of Asian culture as BLACK PANTHER was for African culture. I gathered some feedback as I left the theatre, and got ratings of 7.5 (felt it needed more MCU content), 8 (saw many of the things I have just commented on). I've read the criticism that the storytelling was choppy, but I didn't find it so. For me it was more like chapters in a book, completely working together to create a world of content and design.

300,300,"Could be better, still enjoyable","As a MCU fanatic, I've been trying to get excited about the movies they have released post-Endgame, but it has been a challenge. That particular film was such a perfect finale for the series that I have struggled with the efforts to get the storyline going again. It doesn't help that they have been so scattered in topics, lacking a single core group to bring them all together. Shang-Chi is another random hero that I only knew vaguely from references in the comics, but I never read any of his books back when I was a collector. I appreciated that this film brought a new style to a MCU movie. The blending of Wuxia into a superhero story was a fun choice.

There were also quite a few great actors in this film including Tony Leung, Ben Kingsley, Michelle Yeoh, and I'd even include Awkwafina in that category. I can certainly see how some other people might struggle with Awkwafina's schtick, but I find her comedic timing to be great, and I was laughing along the whole time. However, the one major name I left out of the ""great actors"" is Simu Liu. Sadly, I found him a little bland. He was okay with the comedy, but I certainly don't see him stacking up with the legends that have come before in the MCU. Heck, Benedict Wong has only about 5 minutes of screentime in this film, but still made a greater impression on me than Simu Liu.

Digging into the story of Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, I'd say it's a fine origin story, even if it was highly predictable. This is the kind of movie where you can stay 10 steps ahead of it, and that is unfortunate. I think that's the biggest problem with the entire film, while it's fun and engaging it also feels like a rough carbon copy of things that came before. It's a movie that is emulating a number of Wuxia films from the past, but it's not as good as any of them. It's a movie that is following the tropes of a superhero origin story, and once again isn't on the level of the best of the genre. You can't fault their ambition, but their execution was lacking.

All that negativity is not to say that Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is a bad film. In fact, I enjoyed the entire time in the theater, and was genuinely invested in the story. I thought it handled the links to the MCU well, but without feeling like it had shameless pandering for the fans, or devolving into obscure references only people like myself would understand. The film had some gorgeous visuals, and created its own world in a way that managed to be both unique but still consistent with the style of other MCU movies. There were personal stakes in the film, despite the fact that the ending fell into a giant CGI battle that felt unnecessary. I can't say that Shang-Chi will rise into the upper echelon of my MCU rankings, but it's better than some that came before.","As a MCU fanatic, I've been trying to get excited about the movies they have released post-Endgame, but it has been a challenge.

And now, late 2021 we can finally go back to the movies en masse, though the road to recovery's far from over.

Shang Chi is part-origin-story for a character we've never known before, part-CG-spectacle interlaced with nice kung-fu choreography in between, all in-universe expansion for Marvel's cinematic ambitions. And it makes you wonder how deeply they thought about paying reverence to everything from Bruce Lee to the Matrix, to Dragon Ball, The Last Airbender and Kung Fu Panda.

Marvel is doing its best to escape the confines of Iron Man's legacy, and this seems like an earnest start for something far-removed from the likes of Spider-Man, and so on. Also makes you wonder if Awkwafina is gonna become a major player outside the Shang Chi movies alone.

Shang Chi is the stuff you've come to expect from Marvel Studios; it's going big and it won't stop with every subsequent film here onward. Though bigger and better seems better fitted for high-concept space operas like Infinity War and Endgame than more earthbound character-driven stories.

303,303,Shang Chi,"Review By Kamal K

Marvels new Shang-Chi was a choreographed dance movie disguised as Kung fu with slow paced action scenes and subtle but detailed components that pull a story together a satisfying but inappropriately fast paced manner. Making the writing seem more lazy and poorly thought out, which for me took away greatly from that satisfaction.

The main gripe I have with Shang Chi is how it just so happens that the Jade neckaces show the path and time to the hidden forest path just days before another oath opens for them to go find the tao lao.

Although the comedy music, and some of the choreography for the fight scenes were good enough to give this movie a final score of 6 out of 10 score.","Review By Kamal K

308,308,A standalone ret-con of previous MCU mistakes.,"With the end of the Infinity Saga in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, there is a lot of room for new franchises to fill in the gaps left by the likes of Iron Man and Captain America. However, this means lesser-known properties like Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (2021) get their chance to shine. And while lesser-known franchises like Guardians of the Galaxy are now household names, I think it remains to be seen if Shang-Chi can truly develop its own integrated identity within the MCU.

Having somewhat botched the introduction of the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) in Iron Man 3 (2013), Shang-Chi attempts to ret-con this by insisting that the Ten Rings organization is a genuine threat to world peace. However, Marvel wants to have its cake and eat it too by including the ""Mandarin"" in this film. There are a few other loose connections to the larger MCU in this film, but they are more cameo call-outs than anything significant. Overall, Shang-Chi is its own story.

The fact that a good portion of this film's climax takes place in a mythical hidden kingdom made it feel disconnected from the MCU as a whole. Sure, other franchises within the MCU have their origin stories. Still, I felt they made it clear how they contributed to the ""whole"" of the larger arc by either introducing characters or concepts in prior MCU movies. Shang-Chi excels in its action and choreography but feels generic in the grand scheme of things as a standalone film. I'd almost wager that its sequel will be much more interesting and that those not already committed to the MCU can probably give this one a pass.

309,309,See Shang-Chi on the Big Screen,"The new Marvel Super Hero film, SHANG-CHI and the LEGEND OF THE TEN RINGS is the kind of film that deserves to be seen on the big screen and Writer/Director Destin Daniel Cretton (JUST MERCY) has crafted a film that earns that statement.

Based on the Marvel comic book character (of course), SHANG-CHI tells the tale of...well...Shang-Chi a financially struggling - but happy - Valet in San Francisco who has a family secret.

Writer/Director Cretton has crafted a whimsical, mythological, mystical and action packed film that settles in at the top end of the Marvel Cinematic Universe family of films.

At the center, newcomer Simu Liu (KIM'S CONVENIENCE) more than holds his own as the newest Super Hero in the MCU. He is grounded, centered and more sure than unsure as he discovers his abilities and his family's secrets. He is a worthy addition to this world of Superheroes.

Joining him is the remarkable Awkwafina (CRAZY, RICH ASIANS) as his best friend, sidekick who handles the drama comedy and action with aplomb. This film makes some smart choices with this character and Awkwafina shines.

The rest of the cast/characters are equally as strong from Tony Chi-Wai Leung (as Shang-Chi's father) to Meng'er Zhang (as Shang-Chi's sister) and good ol' Michelle Yeoh (as Shang-Chi's Aunt) bring strong characters to life. They all shine.

This film also brings back a character from a previous MCU film that somewhat redeems the poorly conceived character from his earlier appearance. I won't spoil it by saying who it is, but I liked what the MCU did with this character.

But, this being a Marvel movie, all of these performances anchor a bigger picture that is filled with action, action and more action - and something else, something mystical.

Here is where Director Cretton really shines. The action scenes are interestingly staged and choreographed well. The first fight (the bus fight that is shown in the trailer) and a fight on scaffolding both particularly work well.

This film does delve into the mystical in the last 1/3 and in Cretton's hands, this ends up working well instead of being comical or inane. I bought what was going on and was rooting for our heroes to defeat the undefeatable, fantastical creatures.

To be honest, the ""final battle"" didn't really live up to the rest of the film so that brings this film down a notch, but this movie did what it needed it to do, it opened up a whole new area of the Marvel Cinematic Universe - in both character and locations - and I am anxious to see where they go from here.

Shang-Chi is an expert of Kung Fu. He is forced to deal with his past, when he's pursued by the Ten Rings organization.

Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is a mind-blowing film. The Marvel Cinematic Universe strikes gold yet again & can do no wrong! Director Destin Daniel Cretton has given us one of the Marvel Cinematic Universe's best origin stories. The action set pieces are the highlight of the movie. It's awesome to finally see the Kung Fu fighting style, utilized in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The visual effects are awe-inspiring. Simu Liu is spectacular as Shaun/Shang-Chi. Liu easily balances the action, dramatic scenes & the Marvel Cinematic Universe's trademark humor. Can't wait to see more of him in the future. Awkwafina is hysterical as Katy. Tony Chiu-Wai Leung is outstanding as Xu Wenwu. Meng'er Zhang is fantastic as Xialing. Fala Chen is brilliant as Li. Michelle Yeoh is excellent as Ying Nan. Florian Munteanu is superb as Razor Fist. The supporting cast is amazing. Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is a must watch for Marvel Cinematic Universe fans & superhero film buffs. Watch it on the biggest screen possible, preferably IMAX. Can't wait for Eternals(2021)!"

It is a spectacle with regards to action sequence and fighting choreography, but the film misses a solid storyline for an origin story as its titular character lacks personality and does not go through any heroic transformation story arc. Simu Liu has a strong presence as Shang-Chi, yet he is overshadowed by many of his more experienced co-stars.","Destin Daniel Cretton's 'Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings' marks a bland start to the new phase of Marvel Cinematic Universe.

317,317,Ten Rings to rule them all...,"Positives:
This is Marvel at its best. A script (with Shakespearean undertones) that melds action with good character development and laugh-out-loud feelgood dialogue. The great thing is that you don't need to be a Marvel nerd to enjoy this one. Yes, there are some fabulous Easter Eggs for Marvel fans (and a wonderful return of a character from one of the early films). But its almost a standalone feature in its own right.


The action sequences are top-notch, particularly an early fight on a careering an Francisco ""bendy-bus"". Some great martial arts reminiscent of ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", made more exciting by the fact that the impressive Simu Liu did all his own stunts.






Negatives:






Timeline?: So, it took more of a Marvel nerd than I am (my wonderful daughter-in-law Bronwyn) to point out that although this film is set (largely) in the ""Present Day"", the events of ""Avengers: Endgame"" actually happen in 2023. So in the Marvel timeline, this is set in between Thanos's ""blip"" and ""the return"". This is the reason why Wong is present but not Doctor Strange, for example.

Summary Thoughts: Marvel goes East! This is a really entertaining addition to the franchise, mixing Marvel action with Eastern mysticism and martial arts. It's an impressive job by director and co-writer Destin Daniel Cretton, in only his second feature (he did ""Just Mercy"" in 2019).

As a Marvel film, there are of course end-credit scenes (""monkeys"" in onemannsmovies speak). A mid-title one is the best, bringing some additional Marvel characters into the mix. And there's a post-credits one which sets up for further sequels but which I found rather irritating.

It's ironic that a Marvel movie so right for the Chinese market - the first to be headlined by an Asian actor and with substantial Mandarin dialogue - might not get a release in China. According to this report, this appears to be for two reasons: firstly that the actor Simu Liu made some derogatory remarks about China in the past, and secondly that in the comics Shang Chi's father is Fu Manchu - a Western-derived character with racial overtones.

This doesn't seem to have hurt it so far. After less than two weeks of opening, it has made $262 million on a budget estimated to be $150-200 million.

321,321,One of the most Emotionally Charged Superhero Movies made in recent times.,"Let's keep aside all these serious conversations about Asian Representation, Diversity and all other societal stuff for a moment and let us all just appreciate Marvel for creating one of the most (if not the Most) emotionally charged superhero movies in recent times.

I'm not even exaggerating, I have been a follower of Marvel since my teenage days, suffice it to say, Through many ups and downs I keenly witnessed all of their works over the years. Trust me when I say that they have very much revamped their strategy this time around.

Excluding their typical set-up for a Comicbook blockbuster, Shang-Chi's familial/dramatic aspects are on an all-time high here. The way this story has been told, it just feels somewhat distinctive and special (Especially, compared to the last few projects Marvel has had come up with).

Other than the apparent masteries in its Audio-Visual departments (as expected); the narrative here infuses a powerful statement, a different outlook on family & self-acceptance. And guess what? It never sounded preachy nor pretentious; not for a single moment.

Another praiseworthy characteristic is the Action sequences or to be precise, all the Choreography behind! An incredible show for the Martial Arts fans and yeah FYI Simu Liu (Shang-Chi); our primary protagonist did most of his stunts, all by himself; that is amazing Isn't it?

Pretty much the same impression applies to all the other members of the ensemble; however, I do have some serious reservations about their respective character depictions.

To start with, Shang-Chi's estranged father (Played by a veteran, Tony Leung Chiu-wai); The writing on his character felt a bit detached and incoherent! Don't know about you, but for the most part, I was rather uncertain about what should I exactly feel about this guy! Should I be sympathetic or furious about the choices he had made? Gotta say this dilemma got the better of me.

Furthermore, the Mother of Shang-Chi (Played by Fala Chen) from Ta-Lo; I do feel her screentime in here should have been elongated a little bit more! Just so the viewers could grasp her part of the storyline too! Other than that, she, herself was pretty great in there. No complaints whatsoever. And Oh yeah, Nora Lum or Awkwafina (The Name, majority of you might know her by). She was terrific in her role as well; the much-needed comic relief in such a sob story!

In a nutshell, I must admit, this was a rather unprecedented gamble from Marvel and It did pay off quite well in the end. To be honest, I couldn't be more pleased about that! As I see it, these Superhero films tend to get repetitious over the years so it's always like a breath of fresh air whenever there is a drastic transition coming straight from the creators, and when it gets backed up by the Big Studios themselves; well that's your cherry on top.","Let's keep aside all these serious conversations about Asian Representation, Diversity and all other societal stuff for a moment and let us all just appreciate Marvel for creating one of the most (if not the Most) emotionally charged superhero movies in recent times.

322,322,What a pleasant surprise this was!,"Visually a perfect film for me watching a film in theatre after 20 months. Going in I expected marvel to half-ass the genre but still make it entertaining like a number of their other films. But I was taken aback wonderfully right from the beginning with the opening narration completely in Chinese. What I saw then was a proper modern wuxia fantasy which with some changes could've fooled me for a Chinese production (maybe I'm being a bit hyperbolic).

As fitting to a wuxia film, the lust for power, the love that conquers evil and the despair of lost love are all seen in this film. And who best to bring all those than the legendary Tony Leung who was the face of Hong Kong cinema through In The Mood For Love and acted in some of the best Wuxia films. He was definitely the best thing about the film. I was half expecting Marvel to mess it up like they use great actors for villains all the time. But he was the first main character to appear and even till the end his presence was felt.

This also has some of the best hand to hand action sequences in the MCU easily. The martial arts action, even when the superpowers are included also makes the action just beautiful which is something I feel the first time in an MCU film.

Awkwafina was quirky but what I liked there was that they kept it platonic and didn't jump into anything at any point. Maybe they'd do that in the future but at least they didn't break the flow in the relationship. Meng'er Zhang and Fala Chen also made their presence felt, as badass fighters. And Michelle Yeoh as expected of her came in and owned the screen when she was present.

I'm really surprised at how much I liked the film. The final fight sequences that rose to the most epic Chinese fantasy fight you can think of is the only thing I was expecting them to not mess up. Maybe it is because of my low expectations on how Marvel deals with the genre and the villain that made me love this so much.","Visually a perfect film for me watching a film in theatre after 20 months.

323,323,A Very Fresh MCU Entry,"When Iron Man hit theatres back in 2008, there were rumblings about a cinematic universe starting, but obviously, nobody expected that we would make it to a film like Avengers: Endgame at the time. Along the way, unknown properties like Guardians of the Galaxy and Ant-Man came out of nowhere as well but were welcomed with open arms. I was really hoping that Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings would follow in those footsteps, and it more than does. With rich world-building, a great cast, and the use of mythology, this is one of my favourite Marvel Cinematic Universe entries to date. Over time I may even come to appreciate it even more. After a first viewing, here's why Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings deserves to be seen on the big screen (if you can).

After being trained as an assassin by his father, Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) is given ten years of freedom from this life. In the present, the film picks up with Shang-Chi (Shaun) as he is living a normal life in San Francisco with his friend Katy (Awkwafina). When the history/mythology of the so-called Ten Rings is brought back into the forefront, his mission is to go and find his father. With the help of his friend and sister, they return home to face the music and it may just end up being father vs son to save this world. From start to finish, this film delves into the fun, the mythological, the family drama, and some incredible martial arts in order to tell this very solid story.

Aside from the fact that newcomer Simu Liu is undeniably charming and very likeable in this role, it's the unique style of the movie that made it stand out from the rest of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Yes, it still has the same look and feel, especially when it comes to aesthetics and comedic relief, but the rest of the film had its own distinct heartbeat. Bringing martial arts into this franchise just felt like a breath of fresh air to me. Not only does it feel simultaneous that they're trying to have fun and pay homage to classic films of this nature, but the fact that martial arts, mixed with actual god-like powers just felt so earned by the climax of the film. Without giving anything away, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is far more magical and mystical than I was expecting, but I kind of loved the finale when looking back on it.

There's really not much about this film that I feel compelled to complain about, but I will say that with as much drama that this film has and with how much it does dive into mythology, sometimes the comedy felt out of place. Awkwafina as Katy was great and I think her chemistry with Simu Liu was great as well, but I think certain cuts to her one-liners felt a little unnecessary for the specific situation. There are a few scenes where moments deserve our full attention, but the film felt the need to cut away to something funnier. Aside from the humour taking me out a few times, this film is just a blast.

Overall, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Tens Rings is easily at the top of the origin films that this franchise has given us and probably one of my favourite entries as a whole. Director Destin Daniel Cretton (Short Term 12, Just Mercy) has done a great job here and the cinematography by Bill Pope (The Matrix, Baby Driver) was also a real standout. I thought the scope of the movie felt very grand and that's absolutely in part to how it was filmed. I almost thought the finale of the movie was going to be a huge negative, but again, after thinking about the movie again, there is a nice progression in the story that makes the climax feel earned, even if a tad overblown. If you're a fan of this franchise, this one is a must-see, but even if you're not, this one can stand on its own as well, having only a few acknowledgements to previous films.

Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is now playing exclusively in theatres and if you're able to go in your area, I highly recommend it.","When Iron Man hit theatres back in 2008, there were rumblings about a cinematic universe starting, but obviously, nobody expected that we would make it to a film like Avengers: Endgame at the time.

324,324,Good,"One of the best origin MCU films. Good story, great and complex family relationships, with it's own identity, a very good balance between action and comedy and really good fight scenes. Between Simu Liu, Awkwafina and Tony Leung it's difficult to decide which was the best, but the acting was really strong all around (also a mention to Ben Kingsley, always funny!). The best thing I can say about it is that for most of it's duration it didn't even feel like an MCU film.

The negatives? Again, too much CGI. It's a huge problem with Marvel and Disney as they use the green screen in almost every scene. I like CGI but seriously, some scenes would look much better with practical effects, others would look way better if they just were shot at location.","One of the best origin MCU films.

Once I found Michelle Yeoh was in it and the great Tony Leung was the true Mandarin, I knew I would like it. Great fight scenes and Awkwafina for comic relief made it really enjoyable, but the return of Ben Kingsley's character reminded me of Jar-Jar in Episode 2. This phase 4 movie is going to be a love it or hate it I think...but for me it was a solid watch."

Always hate it when they make a villain not really a villain as to not offend anyone. Shang Chi's father is supposed to be a pure villain, the mother storyline took away a lot from the real storyline.

330,330,A Great Origin Film,"The next instalment of the MCU, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings has come out and I managed to see it the other day and I have finally found time to review it and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees a young martial artist forced to face his past when his criminal father comes hunting for him.

Main Character Relative unknown Simu Liu plays Shang-Chi and he is really good in this role. He really delivers a strong performance and you will come out of the film really liking him and caring about the character of Shang-Chi. The focus on his family dynamic is really well done and Liu does a great job in selling that and showing the pain that he has been through in his life and bringing this great hero to life. He is also fantastic in the action scenes and that is a huge part of this film and you have to believe in the heroes capabilities and I really did.

Supporting Characters Awkwafina plays his best friend Katy and I feel like this character is really going to split opinion, some will hate her, some will love her. I pretty much hit both ends of the spectrum, I thought she was really annoying in the first act of the film and it hurt my enjoyment, but as she had her role slightly lessened she became much more likeable and her character arc became very clear. Tony Leung plays his first role in an American film playing Wenwu and this is one of the best antagonists in the current MCU. I loved this character and performance, he isn't just some generic bad guy and at times I really understood his motivations and saw the emotion from his performance and it was really strong. Meng'er Zhang plays Xialing and I liked her character here and I thought it really complemented Shang-Chi really well. There is clearly issues there and the film plays it up well, and makes her more then just this female sidekick and she is given a personality.

Story The story is at its strongest when it focuses on the family issues between the characters, in particular Shang-Chi and Wenwu. That father and son dynamic is great and both actors deliver really well in their roles and it makes there clashes feel even more important as you genuinely care about both of them in the film. The issue is that the film kind of strays away from that and tries to focus on too much. It has plenty of exposition scenes and fits so much in that it distracts from the main thing that makes this film great. The final act puts the focus in the wrong place, its hard to explain without spoilers but I think you will know what I mean if you watch the film.

Script The script is okay, the drama is really well done and made me care about these characters and the emotional predicaments that they are put in during this adventure and I actually think this film is held back a little bit by the fact that it is in the MCU. What I mean by that is that it has the humour you come to expect from the universe is here but it is done poorly and I never really laughed at all and that was a disappointment.

Style The film looks fantastic, the CGI is all beautiful and I think it does an excellent job of building this world of Martial arts that is very different to other elements of the MCU. The fight scenes live up to the hype and are the best that have been seen in The Marvel Cinematic Universe, the flow so well and are so hard hitting that it is easily the best element of the film.

Overall Overall, Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings is a great film and another solid addition to The Marvel Cinematic Universe. It isn't top tier Marvel but does a great job of introducing a new hero in Shang-Chi.

331,331,A wonderful addition to the MCU!,"Shang-Chi is one of those Marvel films that feels like the full package. It has lots of brilliant trademark MCU humour and tongue in cheek quips. It has exceptional action which I'll get into a bit more. It also has solid connections to the rest of the MCU, balanced well between being its own stand alone film but laying hints of how this is going to fit into the wider story of Phase 4.

I'll start with the action as this is what Shang-Chi is famed for. Quite simply it's awesome. It has the best hand to hand combat the MCU has seen, and sequences that are steeped in Chinese culture, with the rhythmic style of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon woven into the fabric of this film.

The cast was brilliant. Simu Liu was a fantastic lead, and I'd be happy to see him grow into a big player in the MCU. Awkwafina as expected was fantastic, adding so much effortless humour to the film.

What I really love about Shang-Chi is that it has a very well explored and interesting antagonist. This can't always be said for Marvel films as there have been a few phoned in villains, but Shang-Chi doesn't come close to falling into this trap. Tony Leung really sold his role and gave it a lot of power and emotion.

In terms of plot they did a fantastic job of introducing us to this pretty obscure character. There is a lot of exposition and plenty of flashbacks, perhaps too many but I appreciate they had a lot of background content to feed us so I can't grumble too much. I loved how the plot was so mystical and magical, very much feeling like an epic adventure.

Yet again Marvel Studios knocking it out of the park!","Shang-Chi is one of those Marvel films that feels like the full package.

332,332,nothing out of this world but a lot better then i expected,,
333,333,Showcases the possibilities of Phase 4,"This was the right direction for Marvel to head post-Endgame. Finding new stories to tell within cultures rarely explored is the way for the MCU to continue to entertain.

The fights in the first third of this movie were absolutely brutal and quite innovative. I wish they hadn't front-loaded all of this stunning choreography since the fights later on paled in comparison. This film also contains arguably the most beautiful and artful scene in the MCU with the Crouching Tiger-inspired hidden garden duel. There was a sense of more indie-based filmmaking and I really enjoyed that fresh take on the genre. I would be remiss not to mention Tony Leung, who perfectly brings to life one of the finest villains in the MCU. His character has a lot of depth and is one you can truly empathize with.

While there are still the tropes expected in a Marvel origin film, it succeeds pretty well for the most part. I wish the big CGI battle at the end had just been a personal fight between father and son, but alas. The humor, especially Awkwafina, was pretty hit or miss as well. The Trevor Slattery stuff was great though.

Shang-Chi is definitely one of the best origin films in the MCU and really stands out as a unique entry in the long-running series.","This was the right direction for Marvel to head post-Endgame.

334,334,Really good blend of martial arts and MCU formula,"The bus fight scene is one of the best action scenes of the entire MCU. Just for that scene alone, this movie deserves to be watched on the biggest screen possible. Shang Chi benefited from being a very unknown character and the movie gives him the opportunity to shine bright with his development. The story is really fast paced and even if the final act succumbs to the typical Marvel esque, it leaves you with a pretty solid good feeling while leaving the cinema. A really great MCU movie, a superb martial arts spectacle and a great step up for the Phase 4. Do not miss the two post credits scenes. The middle scene is exciting and the very last one is pretty intriguing. Bring it on, Marvel!","The bus fight scene is one of the best action scenes of the entire MCU.

335,335,The birth of a new legend,"The birth of a new Marvel Hero. And a very successful one. One of the better Marvel adaptations of the recent years and the perfect introduction of this new hero.

Its packed with amazing action, a great legacy and a wisely picked cast who get the chance to portray fun characters.

To start with Simu Liu who shoots himself to stardom with this film. His portrayal was fun as he perfectly mixes the hero attitude with a nice tongue-in-cheek humor and perfectly develops himself without taking all of it too seriously. Same goes to his co-star Awkwafina who was perfectly cast. Having Tony Leung as the to center-part was an excellent creative decision. Then the film has some fan favorites appearing as Ben Kingsley's Trevor or Benedict Wong who round it up to a wonderful Marvel adventure, just as you would expect.

The action scenes are tremendous, as the film is filled with great Martial Arts sequences, (of course Michelle Yeoh is not to be missed here). The bus scene at the beginning is a true stand out action scene in the entire Marvel universe.

Really a good one for the next phase of Marvel, and I like how it links to the whole universe just perfectly. Another Marvel winner.","The birth of a new Marvel Hero. And a very successful one. One of the better Marvel adaptations of the recent years and the perfect introduction of this new hero.

336,336,Elevates itself above the typical superhero origin story by incorporating many fantastic elements from Asian culture,"""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" is the second film in Phase Four of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Starring Simu Liu, Tony Leung, and Awkwafina, it elevates itself above the typical superhero origin story by incorporating many fantastic elements from Asian culture.

In San Francisco, Shaun (Simu Liu) works as a parking valet along with his close friend Katy (Awkwafina). Unbeknownst to Katy, Shaun is hiding important secrets from her - he is in fact a skilled martial artist whose real name is Shang-Chi and he has run away from his father Xu Wenwu (Tony Leung), the leader of the powerful Ten Rings organisation. After some Ten Rings members attack the pair of them on a bus, Shang-Chi discovers that they have stolen a valuable pendant given to him by his mother Li (Fala Chen) before he left for the United States. Shang-Chi grows concerned that the Ten Rings' next target will be the pendant belonging to his younger sister Xialing (Meng'er Zhang), and so along with Katy he sets off to look for her before the gang can locate her first.

Now that the Infinity Saga has concluded, the time has come for some new heroes to enter the MCU. Of course, there are so many to choose from, considering the large roster of characters that have come into existence over the last several decades. Although Shang-Chi wasn't the first one to come to my mind when predicting who would lead the charge of fresh faces into Phase Four, his debut big screen outing ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" successfully cements him as a memorable hero just as worthy as any other past Avenger.

What I believe separates this film from the typical hero origin story is all of the interesting aspects of Asian culture it integrates into the story. I'm all for inclusivity in movies, so long as it isn't shoehorned in there for the sake of appeasing a political agenda, and here it succeeds greatly thanks to the wide array of Asian crew members who worked hard to ensure that virtually all customs are represented. The film never precisely establishes the place Shang-Chi's family is from (though it is hinted to be somewhere in mainland China), as they are seen observing various cultural traditions that don't quite narrow things down to one particular Asian country. For example, there are martial artists resembling Shaolin monks, who are supposed to be from China, seen using techniques from Japanese and Korean folklore. This has likely been done on purpose to ensure that all Asian audiences feel included, but never so much that it comes across as disrespectful. After previously bungling Asian-related matters with the terrible 2020 remake of ""Mulan"", ""Shang-Chi"" feels like an appropriate apology from Disney to all of their viewers.

At this stage, it feels pointless to complain about Marvel films following the exact same template when introducing new heroes so I won't hold that against this one too much. With that said, thanks to some brilliantly choreographed martial arts fight scenes and gorgeous visuals, director Destin Daniel Cretton (""Just Mercy"") has provided us with one of the most unique looking MCU films to date. One scene near the beginning features Xu Wenwu walking through a bright, beautiful oriental garden complete with bamboo reeds in the foreground. A short time later, he is locked in hand-to-hand combat with his future love interest Li. This reminded me of ""wuxia"" films, a popular subgenre of Chinese martial arts movies, like ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"". In fact, this scene was such a good tribute to that genre that I almost forgot this was a Marvel movie and was instead watching one of those classic Kung Fu films my dad used to show me when I was young. You know you've created something special when your film can appeal this effectively to fans of both Marvel and Kung Fu movies.

Considering the last thing I saw him in was the sitcom ""Kim's Convenience"", Simu Liu definitely took me by surprise as to how well cast he was as the film's main star. I was expecting him to be a wisecracking Americanised version of the Asian hero but he actually plays most of the film straight, only responding humorously when absolutely necessary. His dramatic side truly shines when he is interacting with his onscreen father Tony Leung. In fact, Leung's character Xu has one of the most tragic backstories of any character in the whole MCU, which I won't spoil here. Another surprise was Awkwafina as Shang-Chi's best friend Katy. Rather than being another typical love interest, Katy is instead a loyal platonic friend of his who is willing to help him out no matter how limited her knowledge on the field of battle may be. It also helps that she is responsible for most of the film's comic relief.

With a new superhero now officially introduced, it's safe to assume that ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" has shown an optimistic future for the MCU. Its broad appeal to Eastern and Western audiences alike as well as the usual action-packed fun we've come to expect over the years makes it one of the best origin films to come out of the MCU to date. The Marvel hype train shows no signs of slowing down and if things keep going the way they are, it won't be stopping anytime soon.

339,339,"It's very pretty, but the story/plot is mediocre and filled with holes","As far as visuals go, this movie is amazing... like just about as impressive as Dune, it's filled to the brim with eye-candy.

The plot/story however is mediocre and filled with plot holes... the characters' actions are often unrealistic and they will often just 'stare in awe' at their friends being killed, instead of doing the realistic thing, and immediately defending their friends... it's something that happens like 5 times and honestly spoils the movie for me.... if characters in a movie don't act or react realistically and stare at something like a braindead zombie (like their friends getting killed right in front of them, whilst they are holding a gun in their freeking hands), then it's just really terrible script/plot writing.

Overall, the movie isn't as bad as Ant-Man 2 but it's not far behind. Also, Awkwafina's acting style was already old by the 2nd movie she did... ALL of her characters in movies are the same person, and like I said, it got boring after the 2nd movie. I roll my eyes at everything Awkwafina's character does in the movie.

It's a 5/10 movie, not really worth a watch unless you're a real die-hard Marvel fan.","As far as visuals go, this movie is amazing... like just about as impressive as Dune, it's filled to the brim with eye-candy.

340,340,There's Dragon Fights!,"What more do you want?

I honestly didn't want to like this film. As you may have read in previous reviews of the Marvel films, they are all dumb. And this one ends as they all do, with just massive CGI chaos. But did I mention they were dragons fighting?

Anyway, the film is fun. Fun and lively in the sense of watching a water painting come to life. The fight sequences are laborious...sometimes. Since being rocked with energy source that could topple buildings doesn't even crack a rib seems silly.

But Shang-Chi makes it work. Here played by the moon-faced wide-eyed and fun loving Simu Liu. And he does a wonderful job NOT wanting to be anything but a typical slacker. While he carries the burden of a darker past..haunted, even...he does his best to make the best of his situation with his San Fran pal Katy. Now usually Awkwafina irritates me to no end. Here, she is much more subdued and is truly a ""bro"" any guy would want in a sisterly form/love interest. The balance of her hip banter to seriousness is flawless. And quite the joy when not on screen.

Big kudos to Tony Leung. Who has spent generations emoting with the most efficient use of words. He doesn't require much and carries a lot. He plays a former evil doer whose only motivation is love.

His fatherly love for his children is only surpassed by regaining a love he's lost. And truly embodies that person who cannot let it go. But that credit goes to Li, played by Fala Chen. A gentle soul in what can be described as Shangri-La. I could watch her do kata for hours. Her gracefulness would make any man want to open the gates of Hell for.

Much praise goes to director Destin Cretton for balancing spirituality with family ties. This is a very difficult line to tow while trying not to be overbearing. He was smart enough to know that the family dynamics of an Asian household have small passive-aggressive moments that pick at the main characters. But doesn't ever go past the ""you must have honor"" trope that infects a movie like ""Mulan""","What more do you want?

342,342,An Asian Marvel Origin story with all the spectacle you've come to expect.,"Another great and entertaining experience which is very similar to what has gone before in format, but the formula works very well and I enjoyed the film a lot. The Asian style and presentation is beautiful, showing off plenty of folklore and style in both modern and traditional settings. The presentation is very stylish, the special effects were superb and the martial arts fight scenes were fast and exciting The plot is good, focusing on the human and family side of the characters rather than the magical, and sets up a good intrigue for the continuation of the MCU. The acting is good and although the comic relief and cute character did change things up, they also spoiled it a bit and made the slow middle section drag on even more. The ending was pretty grand and epic, but I felt it could have been better.","Another great and entertaining experience which is very similar to what has gone before in format, but the formula works very well and I enjoyed the film a lot.

344,344,Unique. But a very fun film,"I have to say I was looking forward to this one. First film in a while that had no connection to avengers etc so I was intrigued to see how they would do this. And on the whole it was very enjoyable and fun to watch!

First instincts when watching were a little mixed. It was an odd start to say the least and didn't have any idea how this was going to go. And my first instincts on Katy were also mixed. I felt like they were trying to force the humour out on her and I found her character really annoying. HOWEVER..

Once it gets going the film gets better and better. Katy becomes a great character and all the characters development and arcs on a whole were truly phenomenal! For me the best part of the film was the characters and seeing them all develop throughout.

So is the plot good? To be blunt, yes! It's truly unique and uniquely done in so many ways, I don't want to give out anything that would spoil anything, but it's really not what you expect. That's all I say!



I'll shut up now! I'll just say it's well worth watching. It's a great ""superhero"" to have and a great one to watch. And overall it's a fun, visually pleasing and brilliant watch. I recommend.","I have to say I was looking forward to this one. First film in a while that had no connection to avengers etc so I was intrigued to see how they would do this.

347,347,Really enjoyable film 7/10,"Shang - Chi is the new hero of the MCU and everyone is going to love him. Although I have a really deep criticism over fase 4 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I've decided to go watch the movie in theaters (after two years of being away from theaters due to covid). Overall I really enjoyed it. There were still a few moments that I regretted and that were dull. Not to mention ""little mistakes"" that Marvel keep doing with their movies. In general it was a fun experience. The plot didn't have much to offer to be honest: another origin story of a superhero that tries to run away from his fate and responsibilities. Until he is forced to face his past.

This has been the kind of way for Marvel to introduce their new characters in the MCU, I wished they would have been more creative but they do deliver creativity for once. Watching people speak their native language for once was a huge step up for Marvel. The movie is also influenced by many other asian classic films such as ""Hero"", ""Hidden Dragon"", ""Seven Samurai"" and ""In the mood for love"".

Of course it wouldn't be a Marvel movie without some end credits scenes (how original). The end credit scene does confirm the return of Shang Chi at some point, but what the end credits scene does confirm moreover is how the future Marvel films will all get connected. As I said before, I'm less optimistic with this whole fase 4 of Marvel but it wouldn't hurt or kill to watch a few of them. To me, I just wanted to return to the theaters.

Speaking of actors: Simu Liu is a fantastic actor and will definitely become a fan favorite, both him and his character. Awkwafina steals the show every single time she's on screen. Tony Leung is wonderful and acts so well. The whole cast is perfect. If you are in favor of theaters and Marvel movies than go watch Shang Chi.

P. S: the end credit song - Fire in the Sky by Anderson Paak. Is the best part of the movie.","Shang - Chi is the new hero of the MCU and everyone is going to love him.

The acting is good, special effects are solids and the story is not bad.

There's continuity linking to the other marvel universe which is nice for the fans.

I would actually pitch this at 7.5/10, not quite an 8 but higher than a 7

354,354,Precious ... ten times,"Of course I am just riffing off, teasing and making fun of certain things with my summary line. Though there is some truth in there too - especially if you consider the last third of the movie - quite fantastical, pun intended.

But there is so much more here. And while you may have seen the bus scene already (I imagine many times), it still is quite the highlight and works wonders! Because there is even more to it than the trailer/teaser revealed! As is with the plot and the characters of the movie.

I was able to watch it on an Imax screen and let me tell you ... wow! But also wow and much respect to Marvel and Feige and anyone involved that they dared to make the first ten minutes or so in chinese! And throwing a lot of chinese terms (slang?) in there as well - throughout! That gives it a touch of authenticity. How immigrants in America or anywhere else in the world grew up. I do the same with my Greek and German/English.

It is also nice and while I am prone to be sarcastic, I really think it's a good thing to have such a major and big representation - especially nowadays with Anti-Asian hate/crime rising. All because of people blaming China and people of China for a virus ... the movie does not have that as a topic, it is entertainment after all, but in every promo and interview that the actors were involved it was something that was mentioned. Good for them and good for us, that this was made.

I am a bit biased when it comes to the MCU and this did get a pure theatrical release, instead of the Black Widow treatment (which also was available on Disney plus and the cinemas at the same time). So there is not issue when it comes to that. And if you can watch it on the big screen - you will not be dissapointed! Now waiting for the other stuff to drop ... especially after the mid credit scene, that is such a tease ... the after the credits scene might also hint at something, but the bigger tease was midway through the credits (actually almost at the beginning of them to be honest).

Sit back and enhoy the movie and the really funny characters ... and quite a few familiar faces. Some from the MCU and previous entries but also some from Asian cinema!

357,357,The best Marvel movie so far...,"Having seen the trailer for the 2021 Marvel action movie ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" I must admit that of course I was going to watch it, but I feared it would just be another run-of-the-mill-over-the-top-CGI-fest-but-barred-of-proper-contents Marvel movie. Yet, I opted to sit down and watch it, on the notion that it was a Marvel movie. But also because of the cast that starred in it.

And yeah, this movie was over the top in terms of CGI. Of course it was, because it is a Marvel movie after all. But luckily this movie broke the formula of the archetypical Marvel movie and this actually turned out to be the best Marvel movie so far. Well, at least in my opinion. Why? Well, because of the storyline and the fact that it mixed Asian culture and lore into the Marvel cinematic universe, and it was a much needed addition to an otherwise Western-focused series of movies.

The storyline told in ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"", as written by Dave Callaham, Destin Daniel Cretton and Andrew Lanham was certainly entertaining. And the movie didn't really have a dull moment, despite the fact that it was a movie that ran for 132 minutes. I thoroughly enjoyed the entire movie from beginning to end. And for me, this was a storyline with proper contents to it, that also included interesting characters and creatures.

Visually then ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" blew me away. The CGI team really worked their magic with this movie and brought it to life in a very visually fulfilling way. Lots of nice details and jaw-dropping special effects. And the creature designs in the movie were off the charts, I really enjoyed seeing those brought to life on the screen.

The character gallery in ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" was interesting, and that applies for both the villain and good guy side.

And they had such a great cast ensemble put together for ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"", with the likes of Asian cinema heavy weighters such as Tony Chiu-Wai Leung, Michelle Yeoh and Wah Yuen. But the movie was also nicely carried by Simu Liu, whom I was not familiar with prior to this movie. And also having Awkwafina in the movie was just brilliant, because she put on a spot on performance with her comedy sidekick character. And it was interesting and nice to see Ben Kingsley return to reprise his character of Trevor Slattery.

""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" is a good combination of action and narrative storytelling, which made for a very wholesome movie. And it should be said that the action sequences were breathtaking to behold, so very, very nicely choreographed and executed on the screen, taking that traditional Wuxia elements seen in Asian movies and mixing it in with the archetypical Marvel Western-based superhero movies.

I was more than genuinely entertained by ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" and it is certainly a movie that bolsters Marvel's hold for me, as their movies tend to be super flashy with spectacular effects, but rather hollow in terms of proper entertainment and storytelling.

360,360,Indeed legendary,"It's been ten years since Shang-Chi(Liu, charming, stoic) last saw his father, and leader of the criminal empire The Ten Rings, Wenwu(Leung, charismatic enough that we feel a lot of empathy for him, even when he does terrible things that we desperately want him to stop doing). That was also when he last spent time with his sister, Xialing(Zhang, a badass who deserves more screen time. Honestly, I'd be very surprised if she didn't, in future projects). He's joined by his friend Katy(Awkwafina, quirky, providing a lot of comic relief, something I'm told she's in general adept at), for what can best be described as a tense reunion, which allows the movie to really mine the family melodrama, one of the best elements it has. I won't give away exactly what the antagonist intends to do, only that our hero has to stop him. However, he has to figure out how, maybe even if, that is even possible.

Not quite, yet almost ""Black Panther for Asian audiences"", this does a lot for representation(including for women. Some of the best characters in this are female. In addition to the two that I've already mentioned, there is also Ying Nan(Yeoh, wise)), it is positively drenched in Chinese culture(the third act, while in ways it feels like it belongs to a completely different film than the first two, takes an especially deep dive into that. Ultimately, it is presented through a Western lens, and clearly we need to go further in this direction, still, it is a big deal that they put so much of it in an estimated $150 to 200 million major blockbuster, which will be seen by millions of people who would never consider watching an art picture, especially one focusing on a group they don't belong to), to the point where countless times, when it makes sense, major characters in this speak Mandarin to each other, rather than English, which it is subtitled into. And ""don't worry"", for those who think that the following is important: there are white people on screen, and they aren't made out to be ""less than"".

The action(each sequence of which feels distinct, belongs with the rest, and is memorable) pays tribute to many different kinds of martial arts films, acknowledging that they are standing on the shoulders of giants. Jackie Chan, wuxia, etc. The choreography is matched in skill by the cinematography. Not only are we seeing incredible fighting, the camera is dynamic, celebrating and highlighting how incredible it is. That *is* why you hire Bill Pope, the director of photography on the Matrix trilogy, two of Sam Raimi's Spider-Man entries, Darkman and Team America. The special effects are excellent. There are some issues with pacing, and certainly a chunk of this is composed almost entirely of flashbacks.

This features relatively brief but highly concentrated, surprisingly graphic gore(you know, there was a time when the fact that it's happening to beings that clearly are not human, wasn't enough to get away with this kind of thing with a PG-13 rating. Pepperidge Farm remembers), as well as a little strong language. I recommend this to any fan of comic book movie adaptations, and people passionate about diversity hiring. 8/10.","It's been ten years since Shang-Chi(Liu, charming, stoic) last saw his father, and leader of the criminal empire The Ten Rings, Wenwu(Leung, charismatic enough that we feel a lot of empathy for him, even when he does terrible things that we desperately want him to stop doing). That was also when he last spent time with his sister, Xialing(Zhang, a badass who deserves more screen time. Honestly, I'd be very surprised if she didn't, in future projects). He's joined by his friend Katy(Awkwafina, quirky, providing a lot of comic relief, something I'm told she's in general adept at), for what can best be described as a tense reunion, which allows the movie to really mine the family melodrama, one of the best elements it has. I won't give away exactly what the antagonist intends to do, only that our hero has to stop him. However, he has to figure out how, maybe even if, that is even possible.

Not quite, yet almost ""Black Panther for Asian audiences"", this does a lot for representation(including for women. Some of the best characters in this are female. In addition to the two that I've already mentioned, there is also Ying Nan(Yeoh, wise)), it is positively drenched in Chinese culture(the third act, while in ways it feels like it belongs to a completely different film than the first two, takes an especially deep dive into that.

361,361,Very enjoyable,,
362,362,"Visually stunning, looking forward to the next one","Without spoiling anything as this story stands by itself there's going to be a sequel and I really look forward to that. It was that good in my humble opinion. Visually it was just stunning, great CGI's, very well choreographed fighting scenes, and a story that was most entertaining to watch. Some might find it over the top but it's a Marvel so what do you expect? To me this is one of Marvels best movies yet if not the best. The acting was good as well, and that from the whole cast. I never heard of Shang-Chi before but from now he has one more fan. Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings won't disappoint a lot of people, unless you're just not into this genre of movies. A must see for the fans.","Without spoiling anything as this story stands by itself there's going to be a sequel and I really look forward to that. It was that good in my humble opinion.

I found it something special and liked it a lot just until the journey starts and another world opens. From there on we came into a fiction world with dragons and monsters.

It's there that this flick lost my attention towards the story. It takes a while before the action comes back in. But once the fights are on, the effects are really stunning.

Mixed feelings aboutthe result, not bada fter all but with the other world coming in, it lost some points in the rating for me.

365,365,A Marvel for the whole family.,"""The US government was almost toppled by a pretender named after an orange."" Wenwu (Tony Leung)

This quote is typical of the light-hearted but also serious addition to the MCU that is Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings. Although Marvel has always been less serious than DC, this time it leaves Superman and Batman to cry in their capes. Sweet superhero Sean/Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) has more humanity than almost any other hero, and he uses his martial arts only when pressed.

The opening sequence on a bus (you can see the bad coming from other cinematic bus rides such as in Nobody) is rousing and entertaining. It has a fight sequence I laughed through because of its ballet-like composition but satisfying because it sets up character and motivation.

When things get heavy, and they do because Sean must confront and potentially kill his 1000-year-old mobster dad, Wenwu, Awkwafina's Katy, Sean's girlfriend, is there with amusing one-liners throughout the adventure, right down to a life-saving shot in the big ending battle scene.

Director Destin Daniel Cretton deftly orchestrates his fights and his characters' lines with the authority of a much more seasoned filmmaker. He never loses sight of the central motif-the affirmation of family primacy, so that the potential chaos of a giant cast and multiple plot strands hosts a unity glued by character and dialogue.

Shang-Chi is a Marvel for the whole family and especially the cinephiles curious how The Marvel Cinematic Universe can be so diverse, so entertaining, and so perfect a purveyor of our heroic fantasies.","""The US government was almost toppled by a pretender named after an orange.""

367,367,The legend of the ten Marvel movies a year for all eternity.,"'Shang-Chi And The Legend Of The Ten Rings (2021)' is, essentially, exactly what you expect it to be. Not only does it feel like a Marvel movie, it feels like a literal Disney movie as well. This is often detrimental to the overall affair, as the piece should have been much more unique than it ultimately is, and it makes for a much less interesting watch overall. However, the formula it follows has provided plenty of success in the past; this time is no exception. Its highs are where you'd expect them to be, as are its lows, and there is an undeniable sense of fun, albeit cookie-cutter fun, to be had. The film is an entertaining action adventure that follows a young man whose criminal father calls him and his sister back home in order to lay siege to the mystical village he believes is holding his wife, the protagonist's mother, hostage. The villain's motivation is a little underexplored yet entirely understandable. It comes from a believable emotional place and is more satisfying because of it. The relationship between the lead and his no-good dad isn't explored as much as it could be, though, and the flick generally has a bit of a theming issue. The piece tries to tie its events directly into the wants and needs of its lead characters, but it does so in an unsatisfyingly half-baked way and honestly would probably have been better if it played itself as more of a straightforward adventure ala most of the 'Mission: Impossible (1996-)' series. Still, the touches of character development are appreciated and each lead player is written to be as likeable as possible. This, combined with the amicable performances, means that you care about the heroes even though you don't have all that much reason to. This keeps you invested in their stories throughout. The highlight of the entire affair is, for sure, its action. For the most part, the picture stays towards the right end of the practical to CG spectrum. The fights are never exactly realistic, per se, but they're based on competent choreography and clean camerawork. They're, more often than not, really entertaining. Sadly, the flick inches closer and closer towards the wrong end of the aforementioned spectrum the longer it goes on. By the time it reaches its finale (which gives me major 'Fast And Furious Presents Hobbs And Shaw (2019)' vibes for some reason), it's clear that the balance it previously achieved is going to go out of the window. Sure enough, its climactic battle is an entirely computer-generated affair; it isn't all that compelling and goes directly against what made the movie so enjoyable to begin with. No matter how hard it tries to disguise it, it still ends with a big blue beam in the sky. Still, the finale isn't exactly bad. It's just annoyingly intangible and feels a little forced in, even (as do the rather cringe-worthy post-credits scenes). Ultimately, this is a generic yet entertaining experience. Its charming acting and exciting action are clearly its highlights, and its weakest aspects are still decent enough. It's a good movie. However, I can't deny that Marvel fatigue is becoming more and more pertinent in my mind. You know what you're going to get before you get it. Plus, the studio's insistence that it has to perforate every single outing with references to other, almost entirely irrelevant fare is really annoying. Although most of their movies are at least okay, I find myself not caring at all about them. That's sad, really, considering that the MCU has produced some genuinely great pictures in the past. 7/10.","'Shang-Chi And The Legend Of The Ten Rings (2021)' is, essentially, exactly what you expect it to be.

368,368,Fun martial arts action-comedy with some dragon ex machina,"After a flashback, this movie jumps to a couple of slackers, Shaun and Katy, with Shaun proving during a wild bus ride that he is much more than a car attendant. Soon they're on a globe hoping adventure with world-saving dimensions.

The martial arts choreography is terrific, from the opening forest fight through that fantastic bus bit to the final hand-to-hand battle (followed by the big special effects battle seemingly required in every Marvel film). Fights are funny and exciting and that final battle is truly suspenseful.

The cast is also excellent. Awkwafina is as funny as ever, Michelle Yeoh and Tony Leung bring all their seasoned expertise to their roles, and the actors are don't know are also first rate.

Although ... in the case of Simu Liu, who plays Shaun/Shang-Chi, I have no strong opinion. He's a pleasant every man who handles the action scenes well but seems less mythic hero than ""genial best friend of the main character."" With all the other talent on screen he doesn't manage to leave much of an impression, but on the bright side I don't object to him.

The story is fun, the movie does a good job of mixing humor, action, and tragical reminiscences the pace is terrific, and man there are some great fights.

369,369,my eyes couldn't handle the sheer awesomeness on the screen,"Watch this in IMAX!!!! The entire movie has an expanded aspect ratio. You're watching about 70% of the image on normal screens, plus on way smaller screens with worse speakers. I promise, it's worth it

WOWOWOWOWOW. This movie blew me away. I love it. A LOT. From beginning to end. Everything. I walked out of the movie so hyped, silent-screaming under my mask as i walked to the car. It's been a while since i walked out of a movie this happy. I have so much to say.

I love the MCU (a lot), but there are a few things that are frequently lacking. One of them is good fight scenes. They always have awesome action scenes, but specifically fight scenes are usually pretty good, only great in a few movies like civil war and winter soldier. And in general, fight scenes in American movies pale in comparison to Asian cinema (Ip man, The Raid Redemption, anything Jackie Chan).

The fight scenes in this movie.... how do i describe it... amazing martial arts that's fast but clear, filmed in creative and astonishing ways without a hint of shaky cam or quick cuts, against stunningly beautiful backdrops... phenomenal. And they continuously focus on the fights instead of cutting to a different scene after 10 seconds like i've noticed in the MCU.

This is BY FAR the best fighting in the MCU and it's not even close. Has to be up there with the John Wick series and Netflix's Daredevil as some of the best we've seen in America lately. I loved the first major fight scene so much that i was worried it would be the best one of the movie, far too early. Lol. I be stupid sometimes

Another frequent flaw in the MCU is lack of compelling villain. Nope. Awesome awesome awesome. That's all i'll say.

Another of my frequent complaints is that the musical scores, with some exceptions, don't stand out. I think they heard. They're on a good streak with the shows and Black Widow. It's not as amazing as the Loki score but i liked it. It felt unique to this new franchise.

Still so much more to say, need to go faster. This is one of the best, maybe THE best, story in the MCU, especially the way it's told. I loved all the characters, i loved all the casting choices, i loved the performances. There are scenes of dialogue that gave me goosebumps. All the emotional moments hit. All the callbacks hit. There isn't anything that didn't work for me. There's no such thing as a perfect movie, but mannnnnn.

Lmao i didn't mention the cinematography. Why would i wait this long? It's MESMERIZING. A lot. Throughout. It's candy for your eyes.

It's also nice to see well-written comedy with jokes relevant to the scene and characters, that feels organic. As opposed to the ""insert joke here"" method we've been seeing more of, especially in Far From Home.

What's the opposite of formulaic? That's this movie. I never knew what to expect next (helps that i didn't watch a single trailer, they ruin movies). Definitely doesn't feel like a typical MCU movie. It has it's own unique tone and feel and character.

Continuing what i said in my headline, i have this thing where i get goosebumps and start tearing up, not from an emotional moment, but from a scene being so incredible, especially action scenes. Don't know why it happens, don't know if it happens to other ppl. Maybe it's partly because i can't risk blinking. That happened in this movie numerous times. Like ""this is the coolest thing i've ever seen in my life."" hyperbole, but mannnnn

after endgame finished phase 3 (yes i know spider-man), i was so happy and satisfied with the MCU. But i wasn't sure they could ever recapture that magic again. I knew i would watch everything and it would probably mostly be awesome. But i wasn't expecting top-tier stuff any more. Lol. I be stupid sometimes. I am ecstatic to have that notion obliterated. As of now, this is a top 6 MCU movie for me. Wow

All in all, i adore this movie. You may wonder why i wouldn't give it a 10 after all this raving. 10s are super rare for me, only 13 of them, and i watch thousands of movies. Interstellar, inception, mad max fury road, etc. Movies that shouldn't even be called movies. My 9s are rare too, they are my favorite movies. 10s are my favorites of my favorites. Only superhero movies i've given 10s are dark knight, dark knight rises and civil war.

If you're still reading, wow you're awesome! I think this is my longest review other than Interstellar.

I'm still in such a good mood. I can't wait to watch it again, in IMAX. I want to wait a week so it feels fresher, but i might not be able to!

We get some absolutely amazing fight scenes which seem right out of a classic Chinese martial arts movie. My only complaint is that it is a bit too long. It's still amazing with gorgeous designs of the creatures. It truly is a unique film to have a mostly all-Asian cast in a superhero movie.

Here we go...

I'm not feeling this movie. It starts with promise but It lost me after Wong vs Abomb.

The fighting is exciting. The movie lacks excitement though. It's a plain dull movie.

It's about a Karate master and... yeah the movie lost me and I have know idea what it's about. This is the first mcu film that I lost interest for midway. Even Im3 wasn't so bad because I lost interest from the very beginning.

Gotg2, mcu Spiderman 1/2 and IM3 are still the worse in mcu. Shang Chi just joined the club.

A movie so full of emptiness that it makes an empty box jealous

I'm not sure how this is a 7. Fans and the average movie goer should also be held responsible for horrible movies.

This movie ain't a 7 even if you watched this movie as blind and drunk.

They tried to be funny by having Wong be rude by drinking the couple's drink at the end credit scene. That wasn't funny at all. Wizard or not.

Speaking of funny, I didn't laugh once. When I used to watch these movies in theatres, the audience often told me when I should have laughed. I watched it at home, therefore I didn't know my cue of when to laugh.

The mcu needs to chill with the daddy issue plot

THOR Loki daddy issue Black Panta daddy issues Stark Daddy issues Star lord Daddy issues Ultron daddy issues Nebula and Gamora daddy issues Shang daddy issue Wasp daddy issues Scott langs daughter Daddy issues

I have to admit that I had my doubts about this movie but I was proven very wrong since it's an amazing movie. It has a beautiful and very interesting plot that keeps you in tense through its whole duration consisted of plenty of action and nice CGIs. For one more time Marvel succeeded on creating a nice atmosphere and connecting the previous movies with this one with many Easter Eggs so, we expect more in the near future. The interpretation of Simu Liu who played as Shaun / Shang-Chi was simply outstanding and he made the difference. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Tony Chiu-Wai Leung's who played as Xu Wenwu, Michelle Yeoh's who played as Ying Nan, Meng'er Zhang's who played as Xialing and Awkwafina's who played as Katy. The comic relief role of Ben Kingsley as Trevor Slattery was a brilliant idea that also gave something different in the movie.

386,386,"Epic, stunning, and a strong powerhouse story.","5 out of 5 stars.

Shang-Chi and the legend of the Ten Rings is an awesome and exciting mcu film that brings the stunning world with the asian culture. I will say i enjoyed this more than the previous mcu film Black Widow. Shang Chi introduces a new mcu character played by Simu Liu. And Awkwafina which is also a fun addition. While they are being chased by an organization called ten rings. Lead by his father Tony Leung. While Shang Chi learns his abilities and the ten rings. Before his father is trying to use that power for a personal reason.

Great epic plot. Shang Chi and Katy (Awkwafina) enter a hidden world Ta Lao where there is magical mythical creatures. Is like a wow stunning moment when you first see Wakanda in Black Panther. The film does give an emotional story build up and a villain that can be relatable.

The cast ensemble is great. Simu Liu did great with the character along with Awkwafina as his friend. Meng'er Zhang, Michelle Yeoh, Benedict Wong, Florian Munteanu, and Tong Leung all did great.

The set designs and visual effects are stunning and great. Can be colorful at moments. The music score was good as well. The action sequences are great and exciting. Every set piece had an awesome martial arts choreography which was well shot with the cinematography. Director did a great job in capturing the action and fight sequences. Even with the epic climax of the dragon battle.

There are two mid and post credit scene which sets up for further films and has a fun nod to the mcu.

I will say Shang Chi is a great exciting addition and i found the film to be very fast moving. Action packed. And a great family conflict story that is emotionally driven.","5 out of 5 stars.

387,387,A Marvel-ous martial arts joy,"Showing no signs of slowing down hot off the heels of Black Widow, a raft of well-received Disney+ series and arriving not too far in front of the hotly anticipated The Eternals, Marvel continues to put in work that puts many other wheelhouses too shame, with the marital arts infused Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, yet another entry into the brands increasingly loaded catalogue of quality blockbuster releases.

It's hard to pinpoint exactly what Marvel keep doing to maintain the momentum that started all those years ago with 2008's Iron Man, it's absolutely correct when many say a lot of these origin stories and event pictures follow a very set formula from A to B, but with an ability to attract some of the best actors working in the industry today and handpicking a raft of some of the most exciting Hollywood filmmakers around, Marvel have once more struck gold with the incredibly fun and inventive Shang-Chi.

Quite possibly the most visually sumptuous Marvel film yet, sometimes feeling as if Marvel has meet with Ang Lee/Yimou Zhang and in my mind the Marvel film that features the best choregraphed action scenes yet from the spectacle heavy brand, Shang-Chi is a big screen blast that is freshly directed by the upcoming Destin Daniel Cretton who here has got his just rewards after his great debut Short Term 12 and the sadly undervalued The Glass Castle came before this big-budgeted ride.

Infusing his film with a great energy and charm that is enhanced by the work of leads Simu Liu (in a career launching turn) as our likable hero Shaun/Shang-Chi, Awkwafina (doing her usual but fun schtick) as Shaun's bestie Katy and Tony Leung as the unfortunate villain of the piece Xu Wenwu, Cretton has turned out to be the perfect choice to start off the cinematic journey of the fist swinging Shang-Chi and helps instill in his film some nice differences to what we've come to expect from comic book blockbusters of the modern era.

Most notably for the film is the exciting use of hand to hand combat that is delivered spectacularly in two stand out sequences on board a moving bus and then bettered alongside a high rise building in Macau, both these set pieces are easily some of the most noteworthy of any Marvel film yet while also benefiting the film other than its Asian infused eccentricities is the fun relationship between Shang-Chi and Katy than never bothers with adding extra baggage to add weight to their believable and fun friendship.

If there was a major drawback to Shang-Chi's many wins it is in an overdrawn finale, a major problem many have acknowledged previously when it comes to Marvel films, Cretton and his team can't quite stick the landing for Shang-Chi with it being a little too long in the tooth for its own good and slightly overblown and while it features some incredible imagery and technical wizardry, the films rip-roaring start and strong middle section gives way too something lesser.

Final Say -

Another huge win for Marvel who have here with the help of director Destin Daniel Cretton and his talented cast, created an instantly likable cinematic universe that provides the comic kings with one of their most unique and exciting playgrounds yet.

389,389,Yet another superb stand-alone superhero flick in MCEU's kitty.,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (2021) : Brief Review -

Yet another superb stand-alone superhero flick in MCEU's kitty. MCEU's new phase never looked so promising but their products are delivering Better than expected. That Spider Man flick in 2019, right after Endgame, changed many perceptions about Marvel's future and even though couple of their recent series like 'Wanda Vision' and 'Loki' couldn't emerge as clear winners, they have set a solid base for upcoming new stories. Shang-Chi is a new start by all means. Not only because it comes under new phase but mainly because it is a stand-alone film and with a new superhero who is more like using traditional combat methods along with ancient superpowers. When Captain America or Black Panther begun as Stand-alone films, they promised too much and thankfully fulfilled it. Shang-Chi does the same. It may not promise too much like Steve Rogers and Wakanda stories but the point where it ends surely gives us hints of new assembled version of superheroes in Multiverse. Shang-Chi, the master of unarmed weaponry-based Kung Fu, is forced to confront his past after being drawn into the Ten Rings organization. The film has major portion covered by Family values and hence, it may look predictable but does not bore at all. Yes, few scenes are outdated and too dramatic as if we are watching a Superhero Film made in 90s but let's just forget those weak points as Shang Chi has excelled in Visual spectacle. The screenplay could have been better in the second half when the big War was supposed to take place but it actually looks tiny one except for those two humongous dragons which might remind you of 'The Hobbit'. Performances by Simu Li, Awkwafina, Meng'er Zhang, Fala Chen, Florian Munteanu are fine according to less potential available for the roles. Actually, the humour and tone of these characters was great. They all looked normal people when they were not fighting and even though the film has ancient refrences, the character don't actually go too deep to become expressive. Director Destin Daniel Cretton seemed slightly off track in the beginning when he tries to humanise all the characters with that typically teenage humor but as the film goes ahead, he recovers from the childish entanglement. With super explosive climax he surely makes up for his mistakes, rather makes us forgive it. Overall, Shang Chi is another superb entertainer for Marvel Fanboys and even neutrals are gonna enjoy it.

Director Destin Daniel Cretton seemed slightly off track in the beginning when he tries to humanise all the characters with that typically teenage humor but as the film goes ahead, he recovers from the childish entanglement. With super explosive climax he surely makes up for his mistakes, rather makes us forgive it. Overall, Shang Chi is another superb entertainer for Marvel Fanboys and even neutrals are gonna enjoy it.

RATING - 7/10*

390,390,This could've been great if it wasn't for the cheesy writing.,"The story was riddled with holes and plot issues. Since when does Awkwafina's pedestrian character all of a sudden get invited to become part of the MCU team? What's her super power... stupidity? Don't get me wrong, I love her, but her character was lazily written. Then there's the whole daddy issues dynamic - Shang is with him, then against, then with etc.. Then we have these ridiculous dragons fighting, where one scores some power crystals and becomes stronger! This is just infantile lazy writing. There was zero shock value or anything spectacular in the entire runtime, with tedious long middle acts and a bumbling third act. The jokes were cliched and not funny. The funniest parts were Ben Kingsley's character, (of whom was in this for what reasons??) and the ending to go Karaoke - which was the only time I actually cracked a chuckle. You'd think with three writers we'd have something cohesive and coherent. But instead of a Marvel superhero story, we got a Disney evil vs good with dragons thrown into the mix. It's as if they tried too hard to create the Asian version of Black Panther.

It's a shame, because the directing and cinematography were spot on, and great S/VFX - although a little overboard with the CGI i.e. Dragons. The martial arts choreography was outstanding (although again, overboard after the awesome bus scene), and the casting and performances were excellent, especially Leung, who pretty much carried the film on his shoulders. It's a 7/10 from me.","The story was riddled with holes and plot issues. Since when does Awkwafina's pedestrian character all of a sudden get invited to become part of the MCU team?

391,391,8 Rings out of 10,"For the first time in a couple of years, since 2019's ""Captain Marvel"" the MCU introduces us to a brand new hero. Simu Liu who, rather impressively, first asked for the role on Twitter brings us Shang-Chi in a film that perhaps does have some issues with it's ending, but ultimately is a fun, funny ride of the type Marvel have been perfecting for the last 13 years.

Talented, but somewhat aimless, Shaun (Simu Liu) lives in San Francisco working as a valet with his friend Katy (Awkwafina). When he's attacked on a bus, he's forced back into the world of his father, a ruthless terrorist Xu Wenwu (Tony Chiu-Wai Leung). First visiting his sister, then returning to the Ten Rings compound, Shang-Chi decides to use his skills to defend his late mothers sacred homeland against invasion from his father and for control of ten mystical arm rings, weapons that grant their owner immortality and unearthly power.

If ""Black Widow"" was considered a wobble for the MCU, despite the fact I thought that it's a perfectly fine film, then it was important to come back with something that was undeniably excellent. ""Shang-Chi"" was that. It's the perfect balance of humour and action that Marvel have established over the last few years. The action too is tweaked slightly, to more closely resemble the types of Asian led action films that we've seen previously, be that the Jackie Chan style bus fight, or the ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon""-esque flashback fight between Shang Chi's parents. There's some lovely links to the wider MCU, including a return for Benedict Wong's Wong and for Trevor Slattery, Ben Kingsley's ""Iron Man 3"" character whose masquerading role as The Mandarin was one of the MCU's most divisive moments.

It's not perfect. The ending is perhaps a little rushed and lacking a moment or two of redemption earning for Xu Wenwu, but the peaks at the future for the character, and for the 10 Rings organisation is an interesting addition, plus our first real step on what might be the route to the next big bad. Excellent stuff.","For the first time in a couple of years, since 2019's ""Captain Marvel"" the MCU introduces us to a brand new hero.

Much fighting ensues but fortunately everyone eventually learns how to 'get along' when faced with a real threat. You have seen it all before: physics-defying martial arts, monsters who look like the recently swallowed strings of LED Christmas lights, conflicted heroes with wise-cracking 'comic relief' sidekicks (an awful Aquafina and an even more awful Ben Kingsley), giant melees featuring a variety of glowing weapons (but no blood), hyper-kinetic and hyper-implausible car/motorcycle chases, and a lot of clichéd wisecracks, tough-guy dialogue, poseur slo-mo, and heroic vogueing (we're treated to the venerable three-point power landing/slide a number of times). The only novel thing the film has to offer is the excellent rendering of mythological beasts from Chinese culture; otherwise, it's an overly-long (132 minutes, which is 120 minutes too much Aquafina), derivative, repetitive, and ultimately boring entry in the bloated, jejune Micky Mouse-Marvel superhero franchise.","Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) discovers that his all-powerful and millennium-old father is about to launch an attack against the magical village where Shang-Chi's mother was born in the likely mistaken belief that his wife is not dead but is rather being held captive (there is more to the plot than one sentence can sum up but what does it matter... the story is just scaffolding for the special effects).

395,395,Promises good things for MCU's Phase Four,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings stars Simu Liu in the lead role alongside such heavy names as Tony Leung and Michelle Yeoh in this latest installment to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Liu's Shang-Chi must come to his own as the son of the legendary Mandarin (Leung), the owner of the Ten Rings.

I like this film's style most of all. Director Destin Daniel Cretton mixes Chinese wuxia settings and aesthetics with Hong Kong wire kung fu inspired action set pieces, while still keeping it feeling like a Marvel film. There's a surprising amount of callbacks and nods to the larger Marvel universe, pleasing dedicated fans, but the film is still able to stand on its own feet and introduce us to its hero.

Kudos also to the whole filming for these action scenes. Very little shaky cam or jump cuts, especially for the hand to hand scenes. Exactly as it should be. I'd dare to say that this film has some of, if not the best action set pieces in all of MCU.

One of the most thrilling and visually spectacular end battles as well, come to think of it.

Furthermore, the acting is solid, especially from Liu, Leung and Awkwafina, who plays Shang-Chi's American friend. Meng'er Zhang as Xialing, Shang-Chi's younger sister, was perhaps my only real gripe with the film. I could have used either a bit more edge to her or alternatively a lot less. Now she seemed to flipflop between relatable and aggravating.

All in all, not the best Marvel movie by any means, but that's a really high bar to clear. I can simply say that based on this, I'm very optimistic about MCU's continued future.","Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings stars Simu Liu in the lead role alongside such heavy names as Tony Leung and Michelle Yeoh in this latest installment to the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

396,396,The Master of kung fu was really good but not as good as I wanted it to be.,"It was better than the proceeding Marvel movie Black Window. More exceeding the expectations of a Marvel movie. Shang-Chi feels like the marvel movie experience is starting to get back to the normal of the theme ride Martian Scorsese believes they are (I can't disagree, just note that's what I want)

In comparison Shang-Chi is a lower level character. I am a fan of Marvel comics but got more of the references to the Marvel Cinematic Universe in this movie than to the direct comic book references. Those Marvel cinematic universe references were amazing enough to get over the fact that the obvious comic book ones went over my head. I mean this movie's connection to other movies is great fanfare that makes me love it more. So really cool cameos happen that actually move the story along.

I did like what they did with the Mandarin here but do feel they copied and paste a lot of things into the story of Shang-Chi to make a complete movie for a lower level character. From the little I know of the character he more fits into those Netflix's shows they did a few years back but change him enough to justify a blockbuster.

They did succeed in making Shang-Chi's background more fuller. The relationship between him and his father and sister was beautiful, complex and more importantly, never bored me and of course Awkafina as the comedy relief and best friend to Shang-Chi was strategic gold. The story for the background was not that full. It's really a character driven movie for without the amazing performances from a group of actors who know their stuff this story would fall short.

Note, I loved the fact that Michelle Yeoh was in this movie and that gives it a lot, but she's done way better in less effective films (but she most likely got a huge paycheck from Disney just to wave her hands around).

The special effects were good in this flick. I was impress with what was used to make the final conflict and I was convince that the dude from Kim's Convenience was a master of kung fu

Its a good movie but it did not live up to my high expectations of it. It gave me a lot of cool things but really did not give me anything I did not see before, in movies that did it better, but if it's about anything I did spend the rest of the day pretending I knew Kung fu.","It was better than the proceeding Marvel movie Black Window.

398,398,Finally a new kind of marvel story,,
399,399,An easy watch that fits into the MCU well,"A San Francisco valet finds his past catching up with him in spectacular fashion.

This is an entertaining superhero adventure story with an Asian martial arts theme and a number of entertaining scenes.

Like many introductions to superhero characters there is a bit of backstory to go through and this film does it with flashback sequences in a similar way to 'Black Panther'. These are mixed with the action, humour and unfolding narrative of the present day plot. Additionally there is some important exposition added relating to the Marvel multiverse. Personally I think everything depicted could have been done in more than one movie, and not so rushed, but that's just a personal preference. What is presented is not complicated in anyway, but very simplified, presumably so that it can be established quickly and the likes of Shang-Chi and Katy can share screens with other MCU characters as soon as possible.

The tone and general feel of the movie also reminds me of the approach taken with 'Black Panther', particularly when it focusses on a location that, like Wakanda, mixes the sights and sounds of regional culture with the sci-fi fantasy. It has obviously been written carefully so that it displays imagery associated with far-Eastern culture like martial arts, traditional costuming, rural settings, that is marketable to a Western audience, but at the same time it avoids other commonly associated negative stereotyping like exaggerated accents, sorcery, yellow peril, bad driving, and (thankfully) gong sounds. Much of this is drenched with a liberal amount of fast-talking contemporary American humour.

There are a number of highly enjoyable scenes such as the fight sequence on the bus, the various comedy moments, virtually everything that comes out of Ben Kingsley's mouth, and all the flashback scenes. The final dinner table scene is probably my favourite.

Visually as you can imagine it is beautiful and full of top drawer cinematography, editing, and technology-driven effects. For me though the spectacle goes over-the-top, particularly in the final action sequence.

Most actors are solid such as Simu Liu, Tony Leung, Meng'er Zhang, Michelle Yeoh, Fala Chen, and Benedict Wong. The standout performances for me easily are Nora Lum and Ben Kingsley who have buckets of charisma and the advantage of all the best lines.

Overall there is little to criticise, it just feels like what Martin Scorsese described perfectly in 2019 as a theme park rather than cinema.","A San Francisco valet finds his past catching up with him in spectacular fashion.

405,405,Marvel Sprinkles a Different Flavor into the MCU,"Marvel gets mystical in this mashup of the plucky, familiar MCU character and the more stoic, legend-heavy air of wuxia films. It's a fresh mix, effectively breaking the gravity of its more serious moments with a well-timed jape while lending credence and lore to a lesser-known corner of the comic kingdom, but these crossover moments sometimes test their limits. I could see more grounded viewers being turned off by the dragons and soul-sucking demons (far cry from the feasible reality of the first Iron Man, that) while serious fans of Chinese fantasy are bucked by the constant injection of loose wit and slappy one-liners.

When it's rolling, Shang Chi does manage to toe that line and deliver something appropriately new and versatile, a good reflection of both worlds. It benefits from a tight pair of central performances (Simu Liu and Awkwafina as a team of underachieving twenty-somethings) and several big, powerful action sets (the articulated bus fight might be one of the best combat scenes Marvel's ever put out) while tying in a dangling thread or two from earlier films to provide a sense of greater connection. On several occasions, however, it's guilty of being too self-indulgent and losing the narrative. It's great to see Ben Kingsley again, adding nuance to his part in Iron Man 3, but his scenes are the main offender here; excessive and distracting and way too cute.

The action is strong, the dialogue (mostly) works, the scenery looks great, but in the big picture, Shang Chi feels small-scale and disposable. Non-completionists won't miss anything crucial if they choose to skip it.","Marvel gets mystical in this mashup of the plucky, familiar MCU character and the more stoic, legend-heavy air of wuxia films.

408,408,Marvel movie by the numbers with beautiful dragons and charming locations,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is yet another movie inspired by the Marvel universe that has constantly been inspiring the cinematic world for more than a decade now. While the movie follows the usual stereotypes, it manages to stand out with its stunning special effects and locations.

The movie revolves around Shaun, a Chinese immigrant living in the United States of America who is working as a valet with his quirky friend and soulmate Katy. One day, they get attacked by a group of assassins on a bus and only just manage to survive. Shaun immediately understands that the attack must be related to his influential estranged father. Along with Katy, he decides to team up with his tough estranged sister Xialing to find out what's going on.

This film convinces on multiple levels. First of all, the acting performances are quite quirky and convincing. Especially the ladies steal the show. Awkwafina delivers the goods as curious, dynamic and funny woman that anyone would like to have as a friend. Zhang Meng'er on the other side represents a much darker character shaped by dramatic events from the past who is much more difficult to approach with her tough, relentless and independent personality.

The expensive special effects certainly deliver the goods as well. The scenes in a fantasy world, in Ancient China and in contemporary San Francisco are all equally stunning to watch. The fantastic creatures such as dragons look impressive on the big screen.

The story might be predictable but is nevertheless entertaining from start to finish thanks to steady pace and inspired execution. You will truly care about the fates of the different characters as you are watching this film.

However, this film isn't without its occasional flaws. First of all, lead actor Simu Liu simply doesn't have the charisma of the other actresses and actors involved. Casting him was a bold choice but it didn't fully pay off in my opinion.

Up next, the movie desperately tries to connect to other characters in the Marvel Universe. The appearance of Trevor Slattery played by Ben Kingsley is completely random as it only seems to be a pretext to offer some misplaced comic relief. The mid-credit scene starts in an amusing fashion but suddenly involving Bruce Banner and Carol Danvers only seems like a weak attempt to develop a hype for potential sequels. The same goes for yet another scene after the credits that evokes more questions rather than concluding the film appropriately.

At the end of the day, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is an entertaining fantasy action film of the Marvel Universe that should appeal to faithful and occasional fans alike. It's one of the better films in the franchise but perhaps Marvel should focus on quality over quantity instead of becoming a monstrous capitalistic machine that is scarier than any gigantic dragon shown in the film.","Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is yet another movie inspired by the Marvel universe that has constantly been inspiring the cinematic world for more than a decade now. While the movie follows the usual stereotypes, it manages to stand out with its stunning special effects and locations.

The movie revolves around Shaun, a Chinese immigrant living in the United States of America who is working as a valet with his quirky friend and soulmate Katy. One day, they get attacked by a group of assassins on a bus and only just manage to survive. Shaun immediately understands that the attack must be related to his influential estranged father. Along with Katy, he decides to team up with his tough estranged sister Xialing to find out what's going on.

This film convinces on multiple levels. First of all, the acting performances are quite quirky and convincing. Especially the ladies steal the show. Awkwafina delivers the goods as curious, dynamic and funny woman that anyone would like to have as a friend. Zhang Meng'er on the other side represents a much darker character shaped by dramatic events from the past who is much more difficult to approach with her tough, relentless and independent personality.

412,412,"A fun time at the movies, and that's all it really needed to be","Charming and incredibly fun- Shang-Chi may not be the best Marvel has had to offer- but it is one of their better films in some time. My main problems with the film lie in the films storyline, which to be honest, is really good, but incredibly all over the place editing wise and there is just so much of it that it feels like two movies could have been made out of it. I love that we get a more in depth look at our characters, their flaws, their regrets, the tragedy in their lives- but the editing makes it feel rather out of place at times- and takes away from the impact the film could have had and its heart. That being said, the film still manages to be very enjoyable throughout. The action scenes are absolutely incredible, the look of the film incredibly well developed- something very fresh and original for Marvel studios- and the cast are all a joy to watch- especially Simu Liu and Aquafina in the lead and supporting roles. I was skeptical of Aquafina being in a Marvel movie for sure, but she really helped the film as a whole, and honestly I would love to see more of her character in future Marvel projects. The film is entertaining, despite the pacing of the film being a bit all over the place at times. It has some brilliant, elaborate special effects that you will be gawking at on the screen, and plenty of surprises that will be bound to make you smile. In the end, Shang-Chi was a fun time for a Marvel movie- something most comic-book flicks have forgotten about recently- and i'm excited what this character has to offer in future films.

413,413,Shang-Chi and NOT the Ten Rings -_-,"As someone that really enjoys the MCU, I'm starting to wonder if COVID may have killed it. Black Widow was a meh experience and now Shang-Chi feels like more of that rote, by the numbers repetitiveness. Yes, they add a lot of Asian elements here to bring in other groups and try and lessen the white dominance of this franchise and I appreciate that but this movie felt like it was rushing through the plot to get to the next fantastical element and in so doing really robbed those moments of any lingering significance. Not to mention, the Marvel formula felt so very pronounced. It's so obvious what's going to happen in this movie from the jump and that's disappointing.

That aside, I'm a moderate fan of older Marvel comics and... THESE AREN'T THE TEN RINGS! Normally I don't mind when the MCU makes little adjustments to the source material. Comics are weird and a lot of that stuff wouldn't translate well to film, I get that but so far they've had two big, fat whiffs on anything Mandarin related. Looking at you Iron Man 3. These things are just super generic bands with pretty underwhelming powers which is so different from the 10 rings in the comics that all do something different!

Nerd rage aside, this just felt average to me. I'll probably check it out at some point again but I'm not feeling any sort of draw to revisit it soon. It's a touch more disappointing as I work through the Disney+ Marvel shows which all feel more engaging and more creative than this. Come on, Mouse. Get it together and put some of this TV magic back on the big screen!","As someone that really enjoys the MCU, I'm starting to wonder if COVID may have killed it.

Great Pacing: Shang Chi has a lot of things built into the tale as it tries to make an origin story fit so far into the movie series. With all the information, there might be worry of the pace being off, but surprisingly it is done super well. Never really dragging, but not moving a blinding pace (mostly), Shang Chi's combination tales keeps things moving but not flying over the important elements to connect with characters. The cast gets ample time to give us their backstories, piece together all the cluse of this dynamic drama puzzle, and not sacrifice on the action to come.

Character Development: The trailers may have you thinking this is a modern martial arts film, and in a sense they would be right. However, the movie takes it one step further and goes beyond the punches to instead give the characters some soul and layers compared to the legendary films of the past. Shang's life is complicated and torn between light and dark, his sister as well experiencing the drama in her own manner that parallels the main protagonist. Even the antagonist has layers far beyond what we normally get from the Marvel group, and I loved how well their lines mixed together to make this melodramatic family story fit naturally into the Marvel universe.

The Surprise Cameo: Can't say much without spoiling, but if you are like me, then you will not be disappointed who shows up in the film. Several questions are answered with this character's return and with it many laughs to be had in the manner very familiar to Marvel fans. The inclusion of this character also holds an important (albeit stretch) plot element to give a little more meaning behind it, and I loved the choices they made to include him in the big picture.

The Cultural Influence: Like Black Panther and the African Culture, Shang Chi integrates so much of the cultural values of the Asian provinces into this movie. The costumes are stunning takes on the traditional attire, bringing the past to light while also sewing in some modern styles to jazz up the outfits. Concepts of family honor, the customs to practicing Marshal Arts, and the honoring of family are well-integrated into the story and help give the predictable tale some extra Kung Fu kick. The architecture of most of the setting breathes new life to the typical cityscapes that have been made famous in Marvel, and the legends of the Ten rings scream of the Asian mythology that is seeped int heir history. I loved how well these things were merged into a Marvel tale, and though again a little predictable and flaunting, really elevated the origin story to stand out from so many others.

The CGI Finally Disney has invested in making their movies show off what the studio can do. Shan Chi and the bunch have plenty of amazing things to overuse the computer effects that the modern era loves. Special effects for the action scenes has more realism to it then Black Widow executed, the creatures you will see have a lot more polish and fluidity to their movements, and the special effects involving the ten rings are fluid and holding depth that I felt has been missing in some recent Marvel projects.

The Acting: A great part played by all members on this film, extras included, Shang Chi's cast shows that acting is not dead and characters can be utilized well. Simu Liu as the lead was fantastic, and his campaign for being in this movie could not have ended up with better results. He holds much of the prodigal martial artist, disciplined and focused to be an avid fighter capable of crushing his enemies with his style. However, he also has that troubled layer in the past to watch that helped spread his emotional spectrum. Awkwafina is still the same cooky role she always plays, but this time gets a little more balance and heroism compared to the other characters she has heralded as in the past. I loved how well she was used in this film, and how great she complemented Simu in this role. Leung brings a lot of pizazz to the character, once again giving us an antagonist with so much more than the scowl and fist, and I felt was a perfect casting to play the opponent of Shang Chi. So many other great actors and actresses in this film, but due to time restrictions I have to move on, but trust me they did well in their performances.

The Comedy: Awkwafina is often used too much for making us laugh, and Disney has struggled with forcing a lot of comedy to make it kid friendly. However, Shang Chi has taken some steps back into discipline and used the comedy well to break up the ice. Dialogue goes a long way to breaking in the laughs, with well-timed jokes and gags being the solid punch to the gut with comedy. There are several ridiculous inclusions in this film that at first seem out of place, but then roll back in to be an extravagant joke that had great set up. And the throw in references that come with it and you get a shining beacon of awesomeness that comes with this movie. It's all done so well and I was very happy with the results.

The Action: My bread and butter for most of the Marvel movies, Shang Chi delivered very well on this film's action exposé. The art of choreographed battles brings another homage to Asian culture, and with it fantastic fights that had more bite and impressive skill use then half of the Marvel cinema. It's exciting, it's dynamic, and most of the fights have a different feel to them than what you might expect. Used well in the story, there is purpose behind the inclusion of the battles and each one has a different meaning and stakes behind it than simply punching and kicking. Even more so, the strategies behind them and what is required to win, accomplishes a level of storytelling that has been lost in the modern era, so well done on that too.

A Bit More Adult: The movie is definitely showing Marvel's modernization into the 21st century, and takes a risk of making this film darker and more adult than other installments. Cursing is definitely increased in this one, with plenty of swear words filling the dialogue, but not to the point of being overdone. No F bombs, but some of the language has got a little more bite, so caution. In addition, the tone of the tale is darker, and the sunshine and rainbows of Thor, Captain America, and Guardians is left in the dust for a grittier tale, which again is a plus.

Some of the political moments: While nowhere as bad as 75% of movies today, Shang Chi does sometimes get a bit preachy with the agenda politics of the film. Taking time out to rub it in our faces with an obvious line stating, ""Look what I had to do,"" was a bit of showboating that I could have done without. Yet even this dislike is marginal, given it's very little occurring, has some nice moments that build off of it, and sometimes has a fun lesson or joke built in.

A Little More Action:

The action in this movie is great, and I loved how much of it flowed and accomplished what I was expecting of the film, and things I was not expecting. Yet there were times where a moment of fighting felt a little forced, namely the chase scenes with vehicles that seemed like an afterthought. However, the fights at the end needed some more time for me, and perhaps a little more bouncing between the battles occurring at the same time. Star Wars has done this successfully in the past, showing all manners of battling and giving you a big scope of the battle. Shang Chi has done this better than several of the Marvel films, but still had some room to give us more looks at the other characters kicking butt. The battle is lengthy enough, I'll agree to that, but a little more showing off of the other warriors would have rounded this fight to perfection for me.

The VERDICT:

Shang Chi finally made me feel like we were back into the realm of Marvel I fell in love with years ago. A cultural building world with both origin and story continuation, this hero's quest had all the makings of a fun, exciting and swift adventure we were expecting. Buried beneath the amazing fights and special effects, was a deeper movie than I had expected, using their characters well and integrating them to serve a purpose. Balanced comedy with a cultural inclusion and politics did not steal away from the main theme of the movie, and giving it that adult touch was a plus in my book, though again caution with your little ones watching it. As for limitations, I agree there is predictability and familiarity with the movie, but the fresh twist and balance helps rejuvenate the formula and add minimize the impact of the limitations for me. Though I will say a little better wider scope battle is still needed by them. Overall, my scores for this film are:

418,418,Most Mystical and Beautiful Movie In History!,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is the most mystical and beautiful movie in history! The music, the special effects and the acting all take you to another world. The film leaves you wanting a Morris of your own.

The storyline follows a young man named Shang-Chi (Simu Liu). His father is a one thousand-year-old man and conqueror nicknamed The Mandarin (Tony Leung Chiu-wai), who has only ever used the infamous and all-powerful Ten Rings for evil. When the Mandarin is set to unleash infinite evil on the universe, Shang-Chi has to stop his father.

This movie is a cinematic experience. The fighting and choreography are out of this world. The long slow motion shots make the audience feel as if they are in a video game. Simu steals the show; every fight scene is flawless with his fluid movements and it proves just how hard he worked on his character for this film. Every audience falls in love with Shang-Chi; he's funny, with perfect comedic timing and he knows the balance between peace and violence. He encapsulates what the majority of young adults feel - like not being able to find their place in the world. The movie makes fans feel as if they've known Shang for years. It has wonderful flashbacks, which give the audience glimpses of his past, his pain and how his fears have shaped who he is. The film gives a wonderful all-around scope of this character that feels like a friend we've known all our life. It makes fans excited to see Shang-Chi again. Shang and his sister Xu Xialing are an iconic duo. They're both powerful and, while there's some tension due to their past, they put everything aside and let love shine through. Xialing is a role model, officially joining the Marvel Cinematic Universe's most powerful women. Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is perfect for AAPI (Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders) representation in cinema. It represents Chinese culture powerfully, shows what it's like to be an Asian-American in modern day USA, not to mention that Simu is Marvel Studios' first Asian-American superhero. Simu and Shang-Chi are writing history while also inspiring children and fans all around the world. The film delivers on all grounds; the cameos are shocking and leave you on the edge of your seat.

This film reminds you to search for who you are and let your past guide you to who you want to be. Ever since his mother died, Shang has been trained by his father to use violence. When he arrives at his mother's village, he learns how to find peace within himself and the world around him. He learns to trust himself and to use the rings for good.

I give Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 10 to 18 plus adults. It is available only in theaters September 3, 2021. By Heather S., KIDS FIRST!","Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is the most mystical and beautiful movie in history! The music, the special effects and the acting all take you to another world. The film leaves you wanting a Morris of your own.

The storyline follows a young man named Shang-Chi (Simu Liu). His father is a one thousand-year-old man and conqueror nicknamed The Mandarin (Tony Leung Chiu-wai), who has only ever used the infamous and all-powerful Ten Rings for evil. When the Mandarin is set to unleash infinite evil on the universe, Shang-Chi has to stop his father.

This movie is a cinematic experience. The fighting and choreography are out of this world. The long slow motion shots make the audience feel as if they are in a video game. Simu steals the show; every fight scene is flawless with his fluid movements and it proves just how hard he worked on his character for this film. Every audience falls in love with Shang-Chi; he's funny, with perfect comedic timing and he knows the balance between peace and violence. He encapsulates what the majority of young adults feel - like not being able to find their place in the world. The movie makes fans feel as if they've known Shang for years. It has wonderful flashbacks, which give the audience glimpses of his past, his pain and how his fears have shaped who he is. The film gives a wonderful all-around scope of this character that feels like a friend we've known all our life. It makes fans excited to see Shang-Chi again. Shang and his sister Xu Xialing are an iconic duo. They're both powerful and, while there's some tension due to their past, they put everything aside and let love shine through. Xialing is a role model, officially joining the Marvel Cinematic Universe's most powerful women. Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is perfect for AAPI (Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders) representation in cinema. It represents Chinese culture powerfully, shows what it's like to be an Asian-American in modern day USA, not to mention that Simu is Marvel Studios' first Asian-American superhero. Simu and Shang-Chi are writing history while also inspiring children and fans all around the world. The film delivers on all grounds; the cameos are shocking and leave you on the edge of your seat.

I saw this at the 3D 4DX at the O2 and we were thrown about, blown on, rained on and every other sensation at every turn it was fab-u-lus!

We had some great acting some great humour and plenty of ""magic"", for Marvel fans after the lacklustre Black Widow, the disaster of the Winter Soldier. Two goodens in a row what with Snake Eyes!

421,421,"More movies like this, please, Marvel","Thought I was feeling some Marvel fatigue after WandaVision (which started strong but ended on a bit of a whimper) and Black Widow (which wasn't terrible, but two months later I can't remember anything about it except how Florence Pugh was cool in it), but this one has rejuvenated some of my enthusiasm for the unstoppably huge MCU.

There's a satisfying origin story here, with a few small appearances from familiar characters that add spice to a host of new characters who are all quite compelling right out of the gate.

The action's great, and there's also so much of it- I liked how lots of the action felt relatively grounded by MCU standards, with neat stunt work and exciting camerawork making the action pop (it's only the final battle that gets really CGI heavy).

The humour's also more consistent than most Marvel films, with most of the jokes landing. Also cool were all the fantasy elements and creatures- they were all pretty inventive and well-executed.

I will say the one notable flaw is that there's a lot of exposition in the film's second half, but they get around that a little by having great actors like Tony Leung and Michelle Yeoh do most of the explaining (and there is a lot to explain, with this being a whole new side of the MCU and all), so it's not super noticeable.","Thought I was feeling some Marvel fatigue after WandaVision (which started strong but ended on a bit of a whimper) and Black Widow (which wasn't terrible, but two months later I can't remember anything about it except how Florence Pugh was cool in it), but this one has rejuvenated some of my enthusiasm for the unstoppably huge MCU.

The CGI and location shoots are breathtaking. The fighting is the best I've ever seen and even the training ground sequences have an exquisite grace. The action was balanced by heart. I was concerned Awkwafina would take the humour to campy lows but she truly showed she has some serious dramatic chops. She was not the comic relief!

I could go on raving but I'll conclude my feedback by saying that this is in every way as powerful a MCU solo representation of Asian culture as BLACK PANTHER was for African culture. I gathered some feedback as I left the theatre, and got ratings of 7.5 (felt it needed more MCU content), 8 (saw many of the things I have just commented on). I've read the criticism that the storytelling was choppy, but I didn't find it so. For me it was more like chapters in a book, completely working together to create a world of content and design.

425,425,"Could be better, still enjoyable","As a MCU fanatic, I've been trying to get excited about the movies they have released post-Endgame, but it has been a challenge. That particular film was such a perfect finale for the series that I have struggled with the efforts to get the storyline going again. It doesn't help that they have been so scattered in topics, lacking a single core group to bring them all together. Shang-Chi is another random hero that I only knew vaguely from references in the comics, but I never read any of his books back when I was a collector. I appreciated that this film brought a new style to a MCU movie. The blending of Wuxia into a superhero story was a fun choice.

There were also quite a few great actors in this film including Tony Leung, Ben Kingsley, Michelle Yeoh, and I'd even include Awkwafina in that category. I can certainly see how some other people might struggle with Awkwafina's schtick, but I find her comedic timing to be great, and I was laughing along the whole time. However, the one major name I left out of the ""great actors"" is Simu Liu. Sadly, I found him a little bland. He was okay with the comedy, but I certainly don't see him stacking up with the legends that have come before in the MCU. Heck, Benedict Wong has only about 5 minutes of screentime in this film, but still made a greater impression on me than Simu Liu.

Digging into the story of Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, I'd say it's a fine origin story, even if it was highly predictable. This is the kind of movie where you can stay 10 steps ahead of it, and that is unfortunate. I think that's the biggest problem with the entire film, while it's fun and engaging it also feels like a rough carbon copy of things that came before. It's a movie that is emulating a number of Wuxia films from the past, but it's not as good as any of them. It's a movie that is following the tropes of a superhero origin story, and once again isn't on the level of the best of the genre. You can't fault their ambition, but their execution was lacking.

All that negativity is not to say that Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is a bad film. In fact, I enjoyed the entire time in the theater, and was genuinely invested in the story. I thought it handled the links to the MCU well, but without feeling like it had shameless pandering for the fans, or devolving into obscure references only people like myself would understand. The film had some gorgeous visuals, and created its own world in a way that managed to be both unique but still consistent with the style of other MCU movies. There were personal stakes in the film, despite the fact that the ending fell into a giant CGI battle that felt unnecessary. I can't say that Shang-Chi will rise into the upper echelon of my MCU rankings, but it's better than some that came before.","As a MCU fanatic, I've been trying to get excited about the movies they have released post-Endgame, but it has been a challenge.

Shang Chi is part-origin-story for a character we've never known before, part-CG-spectacle interlaced with nice kung-fu choreography in between, all in-universe expansion for Marvel's cinematic ambitions.

428,428,Shang Chi,"Review By Kamal K

Marvels new Shang-Chi was a choreographed dance movie disguised as Kung fu with slow paced action scenes and subtle but detailed components that pull a story together a satisfying but inappropriately fast paced manner. Making the writing seem more lazy and poorly thought out, which for me took away greatly from that satisfaction.

The main gripe I have with Shang Chi is how it just so happens that the Jade neckaces show the path and time to the hidden forest path just days before another oath opens for them to go find the tao lao.

Although the comedy music, and some of the choreography for the fight scenes were good enough to give this movie a final score of 6 out of 10 score.","Review By Kamal K

433,433,A standalone ret-con of previous MCU mistakes.,"With the end of the Infinity Saga in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, there is a lot of room for new franchises to fill in the gaps left by the likes of Iron Man and Captain America. However, this means lesser-known properties like Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (2021) get their chance to shine. And while lesser-known franchises like Guardians of the Galaxy are now household names, I think it remains to be seen if Shang-Chi can truly develop its own integrated identity within the MCU.

Having somewhat botched the introduction of the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) in Iron Man 3 (2013), Shang-Chi attempts to ret-con this by insisting that the Ten Rings organization is a genuine threat to world peace. However, Marvel wants to have its cake and eat it too by including the ""Mandarin"" in this film. There are a few other loose connections to the larger MCU in this film, but they are more cameo call-outs than anything significant. Overall, Shang-Chi is its own story.

The fact that a good portion of this film's climax takes place in a mythical hidden kingdom made it feel disconnected from the MCU as a whole. Sure, other franchises within the MCU have their origin stories. Still, I felt they made it clear how they contributed to the ""whole"" of the larger arc by either introducing characters or concepts in prior MCU movies. Shang-Chi excels in its action and choreography but feels generic in the grand scheme of things as a standalone film. I'd almost wager that its sequel will be much more interesting and that those not already committed to the MCU can probably give this one a pass.

434,434,See Shang-Chi on the Big Screen,"The new Marvel Super Hero film, SHANG-CHI and the LEGEND OF THE TEN RINGS is the kind of film that deserves to be seen on the big screen and Writer/Director Destin Daniel Cretton (JUST MERCY) has crafted a film that earns that statement.

Based on the Marvel comic book character (of course), SHANG-CHI tells the tale of...well...Shang-Chi a financially struggling - but happy - Valet in San Francisco who has a family secret.

Writer/Director Cretton has crafted a whimsical, mythological, mystical and action packed film that settles in at the top end of the Marvel Cinematic Universe family of films.

At the center, newcomer Simu Liu (KIM'S CONVENIENCE) more than holds his own as the newest Super Hero in the MCU. He is grounded, centered and more sure than unsure as he discovers his abilities and his family's secrets. He is a worthy addition to this world of Superheroes.

Joining him is the remarkable Awkwafina (CRAZY, RICH ASIANS) as his best friend, sidekick who handles the drama comedy and action with aplomb. This film makes some smart choices with this character and Awkwafina shines.

The rest of the cast/characters are equally as strong from Tony Chi-Wai Leung (as Shang-Chi's father) to Meng'er Zhang (as Shang-Chi's sister) and good ol' Michelle Yeoh (as Shang-Chi's Aunt) bring strong characters to life. They all shine.

This film also brings back a character from a previous MCU film that somewhat redeems the poorly conceived character from his earlier appearance. I won't spoil it by saying who it is, but I liked what the MCU did with this character.

But, this being a Marvel movie, all of these performances anchor a bigger picture that is filled with action, action and more action - and something else, something mystical.

Here is where Director Cretton really shines. The action scenes are interestingly staged and choreographed well. The first fight (the bus fight that is shown in the trailer) and a fight on scaffolding both particularly work well.

This film does delve into the mystical in the last 1/3 and in Cretton's hands, this ends up working well instead of being comical or inane. I bought what was going on and was rooting for our heroes to defeat the undefeatable, fantastical creatures.

To be honest, the ""final battle"" didn't really live up to the rest of the film so that brings this film down a notch, but this movie did what it needed it to do, it opened up a whole new area of the Marvel Cinematic Universe - in both character and locations - and I am anxious to see where they go from here.

Try to see SHANG-CHI on the Big Screen, the visuals are worth it.

Based on the Marvel comic book character (of course), SHANG-CHI tells the tale of...well...Shang-Chi a financially struggling - but happy - Valet in San Francisco who has a family secret.

Writer/Director Cretton has crafted a whimsical, mythological, mystical and action packed film that settles in at the top end of the Marvel Cinematic Universe family of films.

At the center, newcomer Simu Liu (KIM'S CONVENIENCE) more than holds his own as the newest Super Hero in the MCU. He is grounded, centered and more sure than unsure as he discovers his abilities and his family's secrets. He is a worthy addition to this world of Superheroes.

Joining him is the remarkable Awkwafina (CRAZY, RICH ASIANS) as his best friend, sidekick who handles the drama comedy and action with aplomb. This film makes some smart choices with this character and Awkwafina shines.

The rest of the cast/characters are equally as strong from Tony Chi-Wai Leung (as Shang-Chi's father) to Meng'er Zhang (as Shang-Chi's sister) and good ol' Michelle Yeoh (as Shang-Chi's Aunt) bring strong characters to life. They all shine.

This film also brings back a character from a previous MCU film that somewhat redeems the poorly conceived character from his earlier appearance. I won't spoil it by saying who it is, but I liked what the MCU did with this character.

But, this being a Marvel movie, all of these performances anchor a bigger picture that is filled with action, action and more action - and something else, something mystical.

Here is where Director Cretton really shines. The action scenes are interestingly staged and choreographed well. The first fight (the bus fight that is shown in the trailer) and a fight on scaffolding both particularly work well.

This film does delve into the mystical in the last 1/3 and in Cretton's hands, this ends up working well instead of being comical or inane. I bought what was going on and was rooting for our heroes to defeat the undefeatable, fantastical creatures.

To be honest, the ""final battle"" didn't really live up to the rest of the film so that brings this film down a notch, but this movie did what it needed it to do, it opened up a whole new area of the Marvel Cinematic Universe - in both character and locations - and I am anxious to see where they go from here.

Try to see SHANG-CHI on the Big Screen, the visuals are worth it.

435,435,Overall Movie Is Still Great But Not......,"For an MCU movie, i've seen better, and the movie still not on the level like Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Black Panther, Ant Man, and even Black Widow the recent one before this that everybody hate or think it just an alright film but i found it way better than this and it's a perfect movie (in terms of an MCU superhero solo movie), Shang-Chi And The Legend Of The Ten Rings is still an exciting film with a dazzling special and visual effects, incredible action packed, and amazing performance, though the second part/place in the movie didn't work perfectly, and Shang-Chi And The Legend Of The Ten Rings is not one of my favorite and probably the least in the franchise and character but overall movie is still great.","For an MCU movie, i've seen better, and the movie still not on the level like Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Black Panther, Ant Man, and even Black Widow the recent one before this that everybody hate or think it just an alright film but i found it way better than this and it's a perfect movie (in terms of an MCU superhero solo movie), Shang-Chi And The Legend Of The Ten Rings is still an exciting film with a dazzling special and visual effects, incredible action packed, and amazing performance, though the second part/place in the movie didn't work perfectly, and Shang-Chi And The Legend Of The Ten Rings is not one of my favorite and probably the least in the franchise and character but overall movie is still great."

437,437,A Game Changer also its More Martial Arts Than Superhero,"Watched Shang-Chi And The Legend Of The Ten Rings with Simu Liu(Kim's Convenience) as Xu Shang-Chi/Shaun,Awkwafina(Crazy Rich Asians) as Katy ,Meng'er Zhang(The Street Dawn) as Xu Xialing,Michelle Yeoh(Crouching Tiger,Hidden Dragon) as Ying Nan, Florian Munteanu(Creed II) as Razor Fist ,Fala Chen(The Informer) as Ying Li,Benedict Wong(Avengers:Endgame) as Wong And Tony Leung(In The Mood For Love) as Wenwu/The Mandarin.

The Film is great if any of you are a fan of Martial Arts you are going to enjoy this also really dives into the spirituality of eastern mythos of the MCU while still have ties to the MCU Wenwu was responsible for the Ten Rings in the Iron Man films going back to the very beginning also love the father dynamic between Shang and The Mandarin great performances from Liu and Leung as well also Awkwafina continues to be on a role since Breaking out in Crazy Rich Asians and also starring in similar film in Raya And The Last Dragon This Is a Game changer also if your A Fan Forbidden Kingdom your are going love this ,This is Game Changer much like Doctor Strange in 2016. Im also grateful its helping Cinema return to form but im not against Hybrid releases though they help in certain areas also they both can Co-Exist.

Score By Joel P.

442,442,Ten Rings to rule them all...,"Positives:
This is Marvel at its best. A script (with Shakespearean undertones) that melds action with good character development and laugh-out-loud feelgood dialogue. The great thing is that you don't need to be a Marvel nerd to enjoy this one. Yes, there are some fabulous Easter Eggs for Marvel fans (and a wonderful return of a character from one of the early films). But its almost a standalone feature in its own right.


The action sequences are top-notch, particularly an early fight on a careering an Francisco ""bendy-bus"". Some great martial arts reminiscent of ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", made more exciting by the fact that the impressive Simu Liu did all his own stunts.






Negatives:






Timeline?: So, it took more of a Marvel nerd than I am (my wonderful daughter-in-law Bronwyn) to point out that although this film is set (largely) in the ""Present Day"", the events of ""Avengers: Endgame"" actually happen in 2023. So in the Marvel timeline, this is set in between Thanos's ""blip"" and ""the return"". This is the reason why Wong is present but not Doctor Strange, for example.

Summary Thoughts: Marvel goes East! This is a really entertaining addition to the franchise, mixing Marvel action with Eastern mysticism and martial arts. It's an impressive job by director and co-writer Destin Daniel Cretton, in only his second feature (he did ""Just Mercy"" in 2019).

As a Marvel film, there are of course end-credit scenes (""monkeys"" in onemannsmovies speak). A mid-title one is the best, bringing some additional Marvel characters into the mix. And there's a post-credits one which sets up for further sequels but which I found rather irritating.

It's ironic that a Marvel movie so right for the Chinese market - the first to be headlined by an Asian actor and with substantial Mandarin dialogue - might not get a release in China. According to this report, this appears to be for two reasons: firstly that the actor Simu Liu made some derogatory remarks about China in the past, and secondly that in the comics Shang Chi's father is Fu Manchu - a Western-derived character with racial overtones.

This doesn't seem to have hurt it so far. After less than two weeks of opening, it has made $262 million on a budget estimated to be $150-200 million.

446,446,One of the most Emotionally Charged Superhero Movies made in recent times.,"Let's keep aside all these serious conversations about Asian Representation, Diversity and all other societal stuff for a moment and let us all just appreciate Marvel for creating one of the most (if not the Most) emotionally charged superhero movies in recent times.

I'm not even exaggerating, I have been a follower of Marvel since my teenage days, suffice it to say, Through many ups and downs I keenly witnessed all of their works over the years. Trust me when I say that they have very much revamped their strategy this time around.

Excluding their typical set-up for a Comicbook blockbuster, Shang-Chi's familial/dramatic aspects are on an all-time high here. The way this story has been told, it just feels somewhat distinctive and special (Especially, compared to the last few projects Marvel has had come up with).

Other than the apparent masteries in its Audio-Visual departments (as expected); the narrative here infuses a powerful statement, a different outlook on family & self-acceptance. And guess what? It never sounded preachy nor pretentious; not for a single moment.

Another praiseworthy characteristic is the Action sequences or to be precise, all the Choreography behind! An incredible show for the Martial Arts fans and yeah FYI Simu Liu (Shang-Chi); our primary protagonist did most of his stunts, all by himself; that is amazing Isn't it?

Pretty much the same impression applies to all the other members of the ensemble; however, I do have some serious reservations about their respective character depictions.

To start with, Shang-Chi's estranged father (Played by a veteran, Tony Leung Chiu-wai); The writing on his character felt a bit detached and incoherent! Don't know about you, but for the most part, I was rather uncertain about what should I exactly feel about this guy! Should I be sympathetic or furious about the choices he had made? Gotta say this dilemma got the better of me.

Furthermore, the Mother of Shang-Chi (Played by Fala Chen) from Ta-Lo; I do feel her screentime in here should have been elongated a little bit more! Just so the viewers could grasp her part of the storyline too! Other than that, she, herself was pretty great in there. No complaints whatsoever. And Oh yeah, Nora Lum or Awkwafina (The Name, majority of you might know her by). She was terrific in her role as well; the much-needed comic relief in such a sob story!

In a nutshell, I must admit, this was a rather unprecedented gamble from Marvel and It did pay off quite well in the end. To be honest, I couldn't be more pleased about that! As I see it, these Superhero films tend to get repetitious over the years so it's always like a breath of fresh air whenever there is a drastic transition coming straight from the creators, and when it gets backed up by the Big Studios themselves; well that's your cherry on top.","Let's keep aside all these serious conversations about Asian Representation, Diversity and all other societal stuff for a moment and let us all just appreciate Marvel for creating one of the most (if not the Most) emotionally charged superhero movies in recent times.

447,447,What a pleasant surprise this was!,"Visually a perfect film for me watching a film in theatre after 20 months. Going in I expected marvel to half-ass the genre but still make it entertaining like a number of their other films. But I was taken aback wonderfully right from the beginning with the opening narration completely in Chinese. What I saw then was a proper modern wuxia fantasy which with some changes could've fooled me for a Chinese production (maybe I'm being a bit hyperbolic).

As fitting to a wuxia film, the lust for power, the love that conquers evil and the despair of lost love are all seen in this film. And who best to bring all those than the legendary Tony Leung who was the face of Hong Kong cinema through In The Mood For Love and acted in some of the best Wuxia films. He was definitely the best thing about the film. I was half expecting Marvel to mess it up like they use great actors for villains all the time. But he was the first main character to appear and even till the end his presence was felt.

This also has some of the best hand to hand action sequences in the MCU easily. The martial arts action, even when the superpowers are included also makes the action just beautiful which is something I feel the first time in an MCU film.

Awkwafina was quirky but what I liked there was that they kept it platonic and didn't jump into anything at any point. Maybe they'd do that in the future but at least they didn't break the flow in the relationship. Meng'er Zhang and Fala Chen also made their presence felt, as badass fighters. And Michelle Yeoh as expected of her came in and owned the screen when she was present.

I'm really surprised at how much I liked the film. The final fight sequences that rose to the most epic Chinese fantasy fight you can think of is the only thing I was expecting them to not mess up. Maybe it is because of my low expectations on how Marvel deals with the genre and the villain that made me love this so much.","Visually a perfect film for me watching a film in theatre after 20 months.

448,448,A Very Fresh MCU Entry,"When Iron Man hit theatres back in 2008, there were rumblings about a cinematic universe starting, but obviously, nobody expected that we would make it to a film like Avengers: Endgame at the time. Along the way, unknown properties like Guardians of the Galaxy and Ant-Man came out of nowhere as well but were welcomed with open arms. I was really hoping that Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings would follow in those footsteps, and it more than does. With rich world-building, a great cast, and the use of mythology, this is one of my favourite Marvel Cinematic Universe entries to date. Over time I may even come to appreciate it even more. After a first viewing, here's why Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings deserves to be seen on the big screen (if you can).

After being trained as an assassin by his father, Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) is given ten years of freedom from this life. In the present, the film picks up with Shang-Chi (Shaun) as he is living a normal life in San Francisco with his friend Katy (Awkwafina). When the history/mythology of the so-called Ten Rings is brought back into the forefront, his mission is to go and find his father. With the help of his friend and sister, they return home to face the music and it may just end up being father vs son to save this world. From start to finish, this film delves into the fun, the mythological, the family drama, and some incredible martial arts in order to tell this very solid story.

Aside from the fact that newcomer Simu Liu is undeniably charming and very likeable in this role, it's the unique style of the movie that made it stand out from the rest of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Yes, it still has the same look and feel, especially when it comes to aesthetics and comedic relief, but the rest of the film had its own distinct heartbeat. Bringing martial arts into this franchise just felt like a breath of fresh air to me. Not only does it feel simultaneous that they're trying to have fun and pay homage to classic films of this nature, but the fact that martial arts, mixed with actual god-like powers just felt so earned by the climax of the film. Without giving anything away, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is far more magical and mystical than I was expecting, but I kind of loved the finale when looking back on it.

There's really not much about this film that I feel compelled to complain about, but I will say that with as much drama that this film has and with how much it does dive into mythology, sometimes the comedy felt out of place. Awkwafina as Katy was great and I think her chemistry with Simu Liu was great as well, but I think certain cuts to her one-liners felt a little unnecessary for the specific situation. There are a few scenes where moments deserve our full attention, but the film felt the need to cut away to something funnier. Aside from the humour taking me out a few times, this film is just a blast.

Overall, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Tens Rings is easily at the top of the origin films that this franchise has given us and probably one of my favourite entries as a whole. Director Destin Daniel Cretton (Short Term 12, Just Mercy) has done a great job here and the cinematography by Bill Pope (The Matrix, Baby Driver) was also a real standout. I thought the scope of the movie felt very grand and that's absolutely in part to how it was filmed. I almost thought the finale of the movie was going to be a huge negative, but again, after thinking about the movie again, there is a nice progression in the story that makes the climax feel earned, even if a tad overblown. If you're a fan of this franchise, this one is a must-see, but even if you're not, this one can stand on its own as well, having only a few acknowledgements to previous films.

Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is now playing exclusively in theatres and if you're able to go in your area, I highly recommend it.","When Iron Man hit theatres back in 2008, there were rumblings about a cinematic universe starting, but obviously, nobody expected that we would make it to a film like Avengers: Endgame at the time.

Not only does it feel simultaneous that they're trying to have fun and pay homage to classic films of this nature, but the fact that martial arts, mixed with actual god-like powers just felt so earned by the climax of the film. Without giving anything away, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is far more magical and mystical than I was expecting, but I kind of loved the finale when looking back on it.

There's really not much about this film that I feel compelled to complain about, but I will say that with as much drama that this film has and with how much it does dive into mythology, sometimes the comedy felt out of place. Awkwafina as Katy was great and I think her chemistry with Simu Liu was great as well, but I think certain cuts to her one-liners felt a little unnecessary for the specific situation. There are a few scenes where moments deserve our full attention, but the film felt the need to cut away to something funnier. Aside from the humour taking me out a few times, this film is just a blast.

Overall, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Tens Rings is easily at the top of the origin films that this franchise has given us and probably one of my favourite entries as a whole. Director Destin Daniel Cretton (Short Term 12, Just Mercy) has done a great job here and the cinematography by Bill Pope (The Matrix, Baby Driver) was also a real standout. I thought the scope of the movie felt very grand and that's absolutely in part to how it was filmed. I almost thought the finale of the movie was going to be a huge negative, but again, after thinking about the movie again, there is a nice progression in the story that makes the climax feel earned, even if a tad overblown. If you're a fan of this franchise, this one is a must-see, but even if you're not, this one can stand on its own as well, having only a few acknowledgements to previous films.

Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is now playing exclusively in theatres and if you're able to go in your area, I highly recommend it."
449,449,Good,"One of the best origin MCU films. Good story, great and complex family relationships, with it's own identity, a very good balance between action and comedy and really good fight scenes. Between Simu Liu, Awkwafina and Tony Leung it's difficult to decide which was the best, but the acting was really strong all around (also a mention to Ben Kingsley, always funny!). The best thing I can say about it is that for most of it's duration it didn't even feel like an MCU film.

The negatives? Again, too much CGI. It's a huge problem with Marvel and Disney as they use the green screen in almost every scene. I like CGI but seriously, some scenes would look much better with practical effects, others would look way better if they just were shot at location.","One of the best origin MCU films.

Always hate it when they make a villain not really a villain as to not offend anyone. Shang Chi's father is supposed to be a pure villain, the mother storyline took away a lot from the real storyline.

455,455,A Great Origin Film,"The next instalment of the MCU, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings has come out and I managed to see it the other day and I have finally found time to review it and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees a young martial artist forced to face his past when his criminal father comes hunting for him.

Main Character Relative unknown Simu Liu plays Shang-Chi and he is really good in this role. He really delivers a strong performance and you will come out of the film really liking him and caring about the character of Shang-Chi. The focus on his family dynamic is really well done and Liu does a great job in selling that and showing the pain that he has been through in his life and bringing this great hero to life. He is also fantastic in the action scenes and that is a huge part of this film and you have to believe in the heroes capabilities and I really did.

Supporting Characters Awkwafina plays his best friend Katy and I feel like this character is really going to split opinion, some will hate her, some will love her. I pretty much hit both ends of the spectrum, I thought she was really annoying in the first act of the film and it hurt my enjoyment, but as she had her role slightly lessened she became much more likeable and her character arc became very clear. Tony Leung plays his first role in an American film playing Wenwu and this is one of the best antagonists in the current MCU. I loved this character and performance, he isn't just some generic bad guy and at times I really understood his motivations and saw the emotion from his performance and it was really strong. Meng'er Zhang plays Xialing and I liked her character here and I thought it really complemented Shang-Chi really well. There is clearly issues there and the film plays it up well, and makes her more then just this female sidekick and she is given a personality.

Story The story is at its strongest when it focuses on the family issues between the characters, in particular Shang-Chi and Wenwu. That father and son dynamic is great and both actors deliver really well in their roles and it makes there clashes feel even more important as you genuinely care about both of them in the film. The issue is that the film kind of strays away from that and tries to focus on too much. It has plenty of exposition scenes and fits so much in that it distracts from the main thing that makes this film great. The final act puts the focus in the wrong place, its hard to explain without spoilers but I think you will know what I mean if you watch the film.

Script The script is okay, the drama is really well done and made me care about these characters and the emotional predicaments that they are put in during this adventure and I actually think this film is held back a little bit by the fact that it is in the MCU. What I mean by that is that it has the humour you come to expect from the universe is here but it is done poorly and I never really laughed at all and that was a disappointment.

Style The film looks fantastic, the CGI is all beautiful and I think it does an excellent job of building this world of Martial arts that is very different to other elements of the MCU. The fight scenes live up to the hype and are the best that have been seen in The Marvel Cinematic Universe, the flow so well and are so hard hitting that it is easily the best element of the film.

Overall Overall, Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings is a great film and another solid addition to The Marvel Cinematic Universe. It isn't top tier Marvel but does a great job of introducing a new hero in Shang-Chi.

456,456,A wonderful addition to the MCU!,"Shang-Chi is one of those Marvel films that feels like the full package. It has lots of brilliant trademark MCU humour and tongue in cheek quips. It has exceptional action which I'll get into a bit more. It also has solid connections to the rest of the MCU, balanced well between being its own stand alone film but laying hints of how this is going to fit into the wider story of Phase 4.

I'll start with the action as this is what Shang-Chi is famed for. Quite simply it's awesome. It has the best hand to hand combat the MCU has seen, and sequences that are steeped in Chinese culture, with the rhythmic style of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon woven into the fabric of this film.

The cast was brilliant. Simu Liu was a fantastic lead, and I'd be happy to see him grow into a big player in the MCU. Awkwafina as expected was fantastic, adding so much effortless humour to the film.

What I really love about Shang-Chi is that it has a very well explored and interesting antagonist. This can't always be said for Marvel films as there have been a few phoned in villains, but Shang-Chi doesn't come close to falling into this trap. Tony Leung really sold his role and gave it a lot of power and emotion.

In terms of plot they did a fantastic job of introducing us to this pretty obscure character. There is a lot of exposition and plenty of flashbacks, perhaps too many but I appreciate they had a lot of background content to feed us so I can't grumble too much. I loved how the plot was so mystical and magical, very much feeling like an epic adventure.

458,458,Showcases the possibilities of Phase 4,"This was the right direction for Marvel to head post-Endgame. Finding new stories to tell within cultures rarely explored is the way for the MCU to continue to entertain.

The fights in the first third of this movie were absolutely brutal and quite innovative. I wish they hadn't front-loaded all of this stunning choreography since the fights later on paled in comparison. This film also contains arguably the most beautiful and artful scene in the MCU with the Crouching Tiger-inspired hidden garden duel. There was a sense of more indie-based filmmaking and I really enjoyed that fresh take on the genre. I would be remiss not to mention Tony Leung, who perfectly brings to life one of the finest villains in the MCU. His character has a lot of depth and is one you can truly empathize with.

While there are still the tropes expected in a Marvel origin film, it succeeds pretty well for the most part. I wish the big CGI battle at the end had just been a personal fight between father and son, but alas. The humor, especially Awkwafina, was pretty hit or miss as well. The Trevor Slattery stuff was great though.

Shang-Chi is definitely one of the best origin films in the MCU and really stands out as a unique entry in the long-running series.","This was the right direction for Marvel to head post-Endgame.

461,461,Elevates itself above the typical superhero origin story by incorporating many fantastic elements from Asian culture,"""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" is the second film in Phase Four of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Starring Simu Liu, Tony Leung, and Awkwafina, it elevates itself above the typical superhero origin story by incorporating many fantastic elements from Asian culture.

In San Francisco, Shaun (Simu Liu) works as a parking valet along with his close friend Katy (Awkwafina). Unbeknownst to Katy, Shaun is hiding important secrets from her - he is in fact a skilled martial artist whose real name is Shang-Chi and he has run away from his father Xu Wenwu (Tony Leung), the leader of the powerful Ten Rings organisation. After some Ten Rings members attack the pair of them on a bus, Shang-Chi discovers that they have stolen a valuable pendant given to him by his mother Li (Fala Chen) before he left for the United States. Shang-Chi grows concerned that the Ten Rings' next target will be the pendant belonging to his younger sister Xialing (Meng'er Zhang), and so along with Katy he sets off to look for her before the gang can locate her first.

Now that the Infinity Saga has concluded, the time has come for some new heroes to enter the MCU. Of course, there are so many to choose from, considering the large roster of characters that have come into existence over the last several decades. Although Shang-Chi wasn't the first one to come to my mind when predicting who would lead the charge of fresh faces into Phase Four, his debut big screen outing ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" successfully cements him as a memorable hero just as worthy as any other past Avenger.

What I believe separates this film from the typical hero origin story is all of the interesting aspects of Asian culture it integrates into the story. I'm all for inclusivity in movies, so long as it isn't shoehorned in there for the sake of appeasing a political agenda, and here it succeeds greatly thanks to the wide array of Asian crew members who worked hard to ensure that virtually all customs are represented. The film never precisely establishes the place Shang-Chi's family is from (though it is hinted to be somewhere in mainland China), as they are seen observing various cultural traditions that don't quite narrow things down to one particular Asian country. For example, there are martial artists resembling Shaolin monks, who are supposed to be from China, seen using techniques from Japanese and Korean folklore. This has likely been done on purpose to ensure that all Asian audiences feel included, but never so much that it comes across as disrespectful. After previously bungling Asian-related matters with the terrible 2020 remake of ""Mulan"", ""Shang-Chi"" feels like an appropriate apology from Disney to all of their viewers.

At this stage, it feels pointless to complain about Marvel films following the exact same template when introducing new heroes so I won't hold that against this one too much. With that said, thanks to some brilliantly choreographed martial arts fight scenes and gorgeous visuals, director Destin Daniel Cretton (""Just Mercy"") has provided us with one of the most unique looking MCU films to date. One scene near the beginning features Xu Wenwu walking through a bright, beautiful oriental garden complete with bamboo reeds in the foreground. A short time later, he is locked in hand-to-hand combat with his future love interest Li. This reminded me of ""wuxia"" films, a popular subgenre of Chinese martial arts movies, like ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"". In fact, this scene was such a good tribute to that genre that I almost forgot this was a Marvel movie and was instead watching one of those classic Kung Fu films my dad used to show me when I was young. You know you've created something special when your film can appeal this effectively to fans of both Marvel and Kung Fu movies.

Considering the last thing I saw him in was the sitcom ""Kim's Convenience"", Simu Liu definitely took me by surprise as to how well cast he was as the film's main star. I was expecting him to be a wisecracking Americanised version of the Asian hero but he actually plays most of the film straight, only responding humorously when absolutely necessary. His dramatic side truly shines when he is interacting with his onscreen father Tony Leung. In fact, Leung's character Xu has one of the most tragic backstories of any character in the whole MCU, which I won't spoil here. Another surprise was Awkwafina as Shang-Chi's best friend Katy. Rather than being another typical love interest, Katy is instead a loyal platonic friend of his who is willing to help him out no matter how limited her knowledge on the field of battle may be. It also helps that she is responsible for most of the film's comic relief.

With a new superhero now officially introduced, it's safe to assume that ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" has shown an optimistic future for the MCU. Its broad appeal to Eastern and Western audiences alike as well as the usual action-packed fun we've come to expect over the years makes it one of the best origin films to come out of the MCU to date. The Marvel hype train shows no signs of slowing down and if things keep going the way they are, it won't be stopping anytime soon.

I rate it 8.5/10.","""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" is the second film in Phase Four of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU).

After previously bungling Asian-related matters with the terrible 2020 remake of ""Mulan"", ""Shang-Chi"" feels like an appropriate apology from Disney to all of their viewers.

At this stage, it feels pointless to complain about Marvel films following the exact same template when introducing new heroes so I won't hold that against this one too much. With that said, thanks to some brilliantly choreographed martial arts fight scenes and gorgeous visuals, director Destin Daniel Cretton (""Just Mercy"") has provided us with one of the most unique looking MCU films to date. One scene near the beginning features Xu Wenwu walking through a bright, beautiful oriental garden complete with bamboo reeds in the foreground. A short time later, he is locked in hand-to-hand combat with his future love interest Li. This reminded me of ""wuxia"" films, a popular subgenre of Chinese martial arts movies, like ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"". In fact, this scene was such a good tribute to that genre that I almost forgot this was a Marvel movie and was instead watching one of those classic Kung Fu films my dad used to show me when I was young. You know you've created something special when your film can appeal this effectively to fans of both Marvel and Kung Fu movies.

Considering the last thing I saw him in was the sitcom ""Kim's Convenience"", Simu Liu definitely took me by surprise as to how well cast he was as the film's main star. I was expecting him to be a wisecracking Americanised version of the Asian hero but he actually plays most of the film straight, only responding humorously when absolutely necessary. His dramatic side truly shines when he is interacting with his onscreen father Tony Leung. In fact, Leung's character Xu has one of the most tragic backstories of any character in the whole MCU, which I won't spoil here. Another surprise was Awkwafina as Shang-Chi's best friend Katy. Rather than being another typical love interest, Katy is instead a loyal platonic friend of his who is willing to help him out no matter how limited her knowledge on the field of battle may be. It also helps that she is responsible for most of the film's comic relief.

With a new superhero now officially introduced, it's safe to assume that ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" has shown an optimistic future for the MCU. Its broad appeal to Eastern and Western audiences alike as well as the usual action-packed fun we've come to expect over the years makes it one of the best origin films to come out of the MCU to date. The Marvel hype train shows no signs of slowing down and if things keep going the way they are, it won't be stopping anytime soon.

I rate it 8.5/10."
462,462,Exciting; Possibly One of Marvel's Greatest Films,"Marvel has supplied their fans with a fast, fresh and funny superhero adventure with unconditionally perfect amounts of exhilarating action and fascinating characters. The enthusiasm noticeably kicks off with sustainable writing, in which an appealing plot is arranged and the excellent protagonists are propped. Secondly, director Destin Daniel Cretton recieves the role of brilliantly executing the visually-awakening tale.

There's no doubt that the real magic belongs to the epic sequences of fantastical action. With stylish martial arts battles and superb effects, Shang-Chi's epic movie lives up to both the hype and its genre. However, there are some ridiculous and unnecessary details. It's also significant to announce the fact that the amount of action is perfect! There's not too much to the point where it's tedious and not too less to the point where all that can be remembered is the dialogue.

Marvel flicks usually include several moments of bland dialogue between the superheroes. It occasionally grows fairly unexciting, but most of it is surprisingly gripping and the entertaining adventure rules over it. Alongside the massively-praised action is humour and heart-pumping credits scenes.

463,463,Ben Kingsley FTW,"Ben Kingsley won this movie. And it was not particularly close. Probably the stunt coordinator came in a distant second? Anyway, I did laugh quite a bit, and the fight scenes were better than your average Marvel film...but not everything was better than average. Most of it was just about average, actually. Special effects: average. Characterization: average. Plot twists: average. I still enjoyed myself, and still appreciated Marvel transforming an exploitative property into something culturally rich. But the diminishing returns of Marvel joints continues.","Ben Kingsley won this movie. And it was not particularly close. Probably the stunt coordinator came in a distant second?

464,464,"It's very pretty, but the story/plot is mediocre and filled with holes","As far as visuals go, this movie is amazing... like just about as impressive as Dune, it's filled to the brim with eye-candy.

The plot/story however is mediocre and filled with plot holes... the characters' actions are often unrealistic and they will often just 'stare in awe' at their friends being killed, instead of doing the realistic thing, and immediately defending their friends... it's something that happens like 5 times and honestly spoils the movie for me.... if characters in a movie don't act or react realistically and stare at something like a braindead zombie (like their friends getting killed right in front of them, whilst they are holding a gun in their freeking hands), then it's just really terrible script/plot writing.

Overall, the movie isn't as bad as Ant-Man 2 but it's not far behind. Also, Awkwafina's acting style was already old by the 2nd movie she did... ALL of her characters in movies are the same person, and like I said, it got boring after the 2nd movie. I roll my eyes at everything Awkwafina's character does in the movie.

It's a 5/10 movie, not really worth a watch unless you're a real die-hard Marvel fan.","As far as visuals go, this movie is amazing... like just about as impressive as Dune, it's filled to the brim with eye-candy.

465,465,There's Dragon Fights!,"What more do you want?

I honestly didn't want to like this film. As you may have read in previous reviews of the Marvel films, they are all dumb. And this one ends as they all do, with just massive CGI chaos. But did I mention they were dragons fighting?

Anyway, the film is fun. Fun and lively in the sense of watching a water painting come to life. The fight sequences are laborious...sometimes. Since being rocked with energy source that could topple buildings doesn't even crack a rib seems silly.

But Shang-Chi makes it work. Here played by the moon-faced wide-eyed and fun loving Simu Liu. And he does a wonderful job NOT wanting to be anything but a typical slacker. While he carries the burden of a darker past..haunted, even...he does his best to make the best of his situation with his San Fran pal Katy. Now usually Awkwafina irritates me to no end. Here, she is much more subdued and is truly a ""bro"" any guy would want in a sisterly form/love interest. The balance of her hip banter to seriousness is flawless. And quite the joy when not on screen.

Big kudos to Tony Leung. Who has spent generations emoting with the most efficient use of words. He doesn't require much and carries a lot. He plays a former evil doer whose only motivation is love.

His fatherly love for his children is only surpassed by regaining a love he's lost. And truly embodies that person who cannot let it go. But that credit goes to Li, played by Fala Chen. A gentle soul in what can be described as Shangri-La. I could watch her do kata for hours. Her gracefulness would make any man want to open the gates of Hell for.

Much praise goes to director Destin Cretton for balancing spirituality with family ties. This is a very difficult line to tow while trying not to be overbearing. He was smart enough to know that the family dynamics of an Asian household have small passive-aggressive moments that pick at the main characters. But doesn't ever go past the ""you must have honor"" trope that infects a movie like ""Mulan""","What more do you want?

But somehow somewhere it felt like the film was actually made for kids maybe because of the story being wholly dependent on the magical dragon.

467,467,An Asian Marvel Origin story with all the spectacle you've come to expect.,"Another great and entertaining experience which is very similar to what has gone before in format, but the formula works very well and I enjoyed the film a lot. The Asian style and presentation is beautiful, showing off plenty of folklore and style in both modern and traditional settings. The presentation is very stylish, the special effects were superb and the martial arts fight scenes were fast and exciting The plot is good, focusing on the human and family side of the characters rather than the magical, and sets up a good intrigue for the continuation of the MCU. The acting is good and although the comic relief and cute character did change things up, they also spoiled it a bit and made the slow middle section drag on even more. The ending was pretty grand and epic, but I felt it could have been better.","Another great and entertaining experience which is very similar to what has gone before in format, but the formula works very well and I enjoyed the film a lot.

469,469,Unique. But a very fun film,"I have to say I was looking forward to this one. First film in a while that had no connection to avengers etc so I was intrigued to see how they would do this. And on the whole it was very enjoyable and fun to watch!

First instincts when watching were a little mixed. It was an odd start to say the least and didn't have any idea how this was going to go. And my first instincts on Katy were also mixed. I felt like they were trying to force the humour out on her and I found her character really annoying. HOWEVER..

Once it gets going the film gets better and better. Katy becomes a great character and all the characters development and arcs on a whole were truly phenomenal! For me the best part of the film was the characters and seeing them all develop throughout.

So is the plot good? To be blunt, yes! It's truly unique and uniquely done in so many ways, I don't want to give out anything that would spoil anything, but it's really not what you expect. That's all I say!



I'll shut up now! I'll just say it's well worth watching. It's a great ""superhero"" to have and a great one to watch. And overall it's a fun, visually pleasing and brilliant watch. I recommend.","I have to say I was looking forward to this one. First film in a while that had no connection to avengers etc so I was intrigued to see how they would do this.

472,472,Really enjoyable film 7/10,"Shang - Chi is the new hero of the MCU and everyone is going to love him. Although I have a really deep criticism over fase 4 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I've decided to go watch the movie in theaters (after two years of being away from theaters due to covid). Overall I really enjoyed it. There were still a few moments that I regretted and that were dull. Not to mention ""little mistakes"" that Marvel keep doing with their movies. In general it was a fun experience. The plot didn't have much to offer to be honest: another origin story of a superhero that tries to run away from his fate and responsibilities. Until he is forced to face his past.

This has been the kind of way for Marvel to introduce their new characters in the MCU, I wished they would have been more creative but they do deliver creativity for once. Watching people speak their native language for once was a huge step up for Marvel. The movie is also influenced by many other asian classic films such as ""Hero"", ""Hidden Dragon"", ""Seven Samurai"" and ""In the mood for love"".

Of course it wouldn't be a Marvel movie without some end credits scenes (how original). The end credit scene does confirm the return of Shang Chi at some point, but what the end credits scene does confirm moreover is how the future Marvel films will all get connected. As I said before, I'm less optimistic with this whole fase 4 of Marvel but it wouldn't hurt or kill to watch a few of them. To me, I just wanted to return to the theaters.

Speaking of actors: Simu Liu is a fantastic actor and will definitely become a fan favorite, both him and his character. Awkwafina steals the show every single time she's on screen. Tony Leung is wonderful and acts so well. The whole cast is perfect. If you are in favor of theaters and Marvel movies than go watch Shang Chi.

P. S: the end credit song - Fire in the Sky by Anderson Paak. Is the best part of the movie.","Shang - Chi is the new hero of the MCU and everyone is going to love him.

The acting is good, special effects are solids and the story is not bad.

There's continuity linking to the other marvel universe which is nice for the fans.

I would actually pitch this at 7.5/10, not quite an 8 but higher than a 7

Those review of 1 or 2 out of ten are way off the mark, this film is not that bad.","I have just watched this movie. I am an avid Marvel fan. This film introduces a new character, there is that standard Disney approach, with a mix of comedy, seriousness and lots of action.

476,476,Awesome.,"Best fight scenes since the civil war airport scene. They mess up simply by trying to make the character 10 years younger then the actor is.

Great addition to MCU , especially after the quality level the shows have been.","Best fight scenes since the civil war airport scene.

Marvel Studios' Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings follows Shang-Chi, a seemingly ordinary young man from San Francisco who parks cars for a living alongside his friend, as must confront the past he thought he left behind when he is drawn into the web of the mysterious Ten Rings organization. Marvel took a big chance on this project. Of course we've had lesser known heroes end up getting their own movie franchise within the MCU, but Shang-Chi is not one many know about. Little was known going in other than we'd get some action scenes and explore new territory within the MCU. What they managed to do with Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings is unlike any Marvel movie yet. Destin Daniel Cretton takes a new approach that works wonders. His previous works of Short Term 12 and Just Mercy are heartfelt dramas so something big like this is new territory, but he incorporates the same style and messages into this. The dysfunctional family dynamic serving as the character arc and forming the conflict is so much deeper than some random business guy who wants to rule the world. With this story, it's easy to connect with it and understand character motives. I will say there's a lot to pack in here and the story can get muddy at points, but it pulls itself together that we retain most of everything.

Simu Liu is fantastic in the title role. Previous to watching, I hadn't seen him in anything. But he has all the skills as an emerging actor to be a household name. Shang-Chi is an interesting character to follow. As he discovers and recalls moments from his upbringing, we can slowly piece him together. There's much more to be made from him, but with future installments we'll be able to get much more. And Tony Chiu-Wai Leung is perfectly cast as Xu Wenwu. He's a villain I can understand, like, and dislike all at the same time. He's flawed, but there's depth to him. And he almost steals the show by the end with another showcase of mad acting skills. But the character I've been thinking of a lot, and mainly because she was so hilarious, is Awkwafina as Katy. Awkwafina is one of my favorite actresses working right now, especially after her role in The Farewell, and she smashes this. Katy is the typical comedic sidekick but so much fun. One of the funniest jokes comes from her and I was laughing hysterically. Maybe more character will come from her later, but what we got was enough for me. I can't wait to see her again! I should also mention Meng'er Zhang as Xialing. This is her first role and she's also great. What they'll do with her next should be interesting.

From a technical standpoint, this is impressive for a Marvel movie. There are some stunning visuals. The cinematography isn't that gray color scheme used in most, though it does fall into that later on, and bursting with color. And as you probably know, the visual effects are as good as they come. It's not muddled with CGI and a scene that was completely green screen, which is nice to see. Also, Marvel has been doing great with the themes and score lately because this is another great one, along with the soundtrack. Paired with this are the best fight scenes out of the whole MCU. The stunt choreography is top notch and is beautiful and intense to look at. The bus scene early on is the best yet and will be hard to top! Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings just really did it for me and most everybody can agree. It's refreshing and captivating in every way. Marvel has been taking some big leaps with this new phase and it gets me more and more excited for each new installment!","""I gave you ten years to live your life. And where did that get you?

The stunt choreography is top notch and is beautiful and intense to look at. The bus scene early on is the best yet and will be hard to top! Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings just really did it for me and most everybody can agree. It's refreshing and captivating in every way. Marvel has been taking some big leaps with this new phase and it gets me more and more excited for each new installment!"
479,479,Marvel goes mystical,"With this film, Marvel shows that there is still no end in sight, and it is getting crazier and more imaginative. The most interesting Marvel world so far, with interesting mythical creatures that you won't find anywhere else. Definitely a visually stunning film, but in which you should definitely deal a little with Far Eastern culture. Not a classic superhero film. On the contrary: Marvel is becoming mystical.","With this film, Marvel shows that there is still no end in sight, and it is getting crazier and more imaginative.

480,480,Works as an introductory movie but has a boring story,"This film manages to introduce the character in this universe, but the story that unfolds is boring.

The conflict changes several times, it even takes the main character to a lake to concentrate on something else, it becomes cyclical, it is incongruous, it has many script holes, you do not feel much emotion when the fights appear. The visuals are very good, the editing is good most of the time, although the sound of some mythological elements is not very good, like the performance of the actor who plays the antagonist, the ending feels a bit forced.

This film is not innovative in the genre and is predictable, making it somewhat boring.","This film manages to introduce the character in this universe, but the story that unfolds is boring.

482,482,Shang-Chi and the legend of The Ten Rings - enjoyably unMarvellous film. 80%,"""Shang-Chi and the legend of The Ten Rings"" is a superhero origin story which seems more like a Chinese martial arts film than the next entrant in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Many years ago I saw ""Crouching tiger, hidden dragon"" and found the fight scenes in that literally unbelievable a lot of the time. ""Shang-Chi"" often seems subtle in its fight scenes by comparison but then does have action sequences which are more like MCU superhero films. As an origin story, it assumes no familiarity with the MCU and in fact plays mostly as a non-MCU film, which is what I liked about it.

Simu Liu plays Shang-Chi/Shaun, the son of a mobster, Xu Wenwu (played by Tony Leung) who could quite easily have been the subject of a film or franchise himself, due to his legendary characteristics. Shang-Chi's mother Ying Li (played by Fala Chen) is also a legendary kind of character. This contrast of 'Eastern' legendary figures and 'Western' MCU legendary figures worked to the former's advantage, as the latter often come across as plastic toy figurines being used in a sandpit by small boys to play with.

The plot concerns how Shang-Chi/Shaun sought to move from under the shadow of his father to become his own man but just when he thought he was out, he is pulled back into Wenwu's orbit. The film mixes the seriousness, perhaps, of Chinese martial arts films with the jokey style of American Hollywood films. As should be expected from a MCU film, eventually the fate of the world will come into play and someone will have to play the hero to save it.

The martial arts in this film juxtaposes frenetic fight sequences with elegant and fluid fight scenes which have their own particular charm. Other times the action sequences seem lifted from a Disney live action family film and that was enjoyable too, if you just suspended disbelief.

Speaking of comedy, I found the earliest instance of this to be aiming very low for laughs, which isn't uncommon in MCU films but I warmed to later instances of it. For instance, I was amused by the character of a thespian who sounded like he was from Liverpool, when he reminisced about what he took from a film that he saw as a teenager and how that inspired him to get into acting. That actor playing the thespian did seem familiar, perhaps for his voice but I did recognise his name in the closing credits and remembered the role that he is perhaps best known for.

An interesting aspect to this film is its subject matter, i.e. An Asian superhero and a mostly Asian cast. Is this another attempt by Hollywood to crack the now important Chinese market? If it is, then the cooling relations between the US and China is an unwelcome fly in the ointment for Hollywood studios trying to make a lot of money from Chinese cinemagoers.

Another question that came into my mind was whether ""The Ten Rings"" is based on Chinese legend or is a Marvel appropriation of Chinese culture, tailored for 'Western' audiences that don't care about cultural authenticity. If it isn't the former, then I think that there could be a niche for films which mine authentic 'Eastern' legends and myths. That could be something which might interest me (Sinophiles would no doubt reel out a long list of films which have done just that!).

As you might have guessed, I wasn't the first in line to see this film. In fact, I wasn't even sure that I wanted to see it, as I haven't watched every line of superhero films in the MCU (maybe I should watch ""The Black Panther""?). As it stands, I think it was worth the punt in seeing it. I'd go so far as to say that seeing a sequel to this would be more appealing if it wasn't tied to The Avengers franchise! Furthermore, I would have liked this film not to remind that it was part of the MCU, which it managed to do, at least until the closing credits, which I didn't welcome when it made its first appearance. With that being said, this is the kind of film that you could watch again, after a suitable break. Although I didn't watch this film in 3D, it might be worth it to do so (as sometimes the extra cost of the ticket gives added value to the experience and...sometimes it doesn't).

Notes to self:

* The narrative did have some logical gaps in it, for example why Shang-Chi was attacked on the bus. What was that all about?

* The film was dedicated to the memory of Brad Allan, I think. Not sure who that was...searching now, a few websites list him as the supervising stunt coordinator.

* Reading the closing credits, I was reminded that this film was shot in Australia, which isn't obvious watching it, so, good job studio (I think I saw or heard something on ABC in Australia about how Asian Australians got to be in this film, perhaps a kung fu exponent or exponents)!

* My score for this film was tracking from 75% (7 out of 10 stars) to 75+% (8 out 10 stars) to just a flat 80% final score.","""Shang-Chi and the legend of The Ten Rings"" is a superhero origin story which seems more like a Chinese martial arts film than the next entrant in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU).

483,483,Phase Four is in Full Swing!,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings far surpassed any expectations I had. It's easily the best Marvel movie post-Infinity Saga (I know, that's not exactly saying much), and is very promising for the quality of Marvel's next projects. We have probably the second best villain intimately tied to the origin of a new, entertaining, and capable hero full of potential, in a story that ties the universe together and teases upcoming events in tantalising and unexpected ways. The fight choreography was on point, the dialogue was seeped in cultural significance, the jokes all land, and the CGI is some of the best since Thanos himself. Shang-Chi is an all-out success for Marvel, it seems in multiple ways - both critically and financially. Really its only downfall is that at times this doesn't feel like that much of a movie about Shang-Chi himself purely because his origin is tied so closely to the story of the Ten Rings. Instead it's a Ten Rings movie featuring Shang-Chi, which is fine, but feels a bit weird for his introduction into the MCU. And yes, the Ten Rings are tied up with the Iron Man films perfectly, almost making the whole Aldrich Killian thing better in retrospect. I give Shang-Chi a high 8/10, with promise of moving up with rewatches.","Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings far surpassed any expectations I had.

484,484,Feast for the eyes...,"I can't decide whether I loved this movie because it's great or if it's just the best cinematography Bill Pope's done since The Wachowski's ""The Matrix"" trilogy?

Either way, ""Shang-Chi"" is easily the most visually distinctive & stunning film in the MCU thus far - vibrant, kinetic, gorgeously framed / composed, with its own individualistic sense of personality - & the symbiosis between the fight choreography & camera work supercedes that of any previous installment in the Marvel franchise - resulting in an incredible style that works effortlessly throughout... I can't stress this enough - some moments are honestly breathtaking (my jaw was on the floor) & it's an utter joy to see such expertly constructed & perfectly timed sequences - of pure, unapologetic cinema - unfold. Allows the audience the uncommon opportunity to just sit back & relax whilst watching, safe in the knowledge those responsible for bringing the screenplay to life are trustworthy, capable hands. Hence, the creator's dependability reassures viewers that they can simply focus on enjoying the experience instead, making it even more fun.

Although I shouldn't be surprised everything's captured so masterfully - considering the reliably quirky inventiveness of the visionary director of photography at the helm of the project - despite his legendary status, I still wasn't expecting a solo film (made by such an infamously corporate production company which normally shuns creative experimentation of any kind, churning out unadventurous, generic, copy + paste origin stories) to be so shockingly well realised on screen, it would consequently make ""Avengers: Endgame"" look embarrassingly trivial & unengaging by comparison... Yet somehow, under the watchful eye of director Destin Daniel Cretton, together, this duo manage to accomplish exactly that successfully, capturing scenes with a unique confidence I rarely (if ever) see in recent comic book adaptations.

For instance, usually, I can't stand the bland, dull, grey, lifeless aesthetics of Disney movies (renowned for their very ugly colour grading & over reliance on CGI) but the filmmaking here feels as uncharacteristically bold, audacious, awe inspiring, original, immersive & as epic as James Wan's ""Aquaman"" or James Cameron's ""Avatar"", utilising VFX effectively to enhance the scale of the tale being told, rather than detract from the overall plot. Of course, technically impressive world building & enormous scale / grandiosity are meaningless qualities & hollow attributes to possess if the narrative lacks depth or engaging characters but thankfully, this offers just enough heart to additionally feel emotionally investable, as well as spectacular.

490,490,Surprisingly good.,"I have to say that this was a surprisingly good movie. I say surprisingly because Marvel (or DC for that matter) have not exactly excelled in making even decent movies for quite some time. That the woke ""critics"" on Rotten Tomatoes gave it high ratings was a bit of a red flag as well but not only was the movie rather free from woke ramblings and preaching but it was a very fun and entertaining movie to watch.

The movie starts off in a somewhat bizarre way with Shang-Chi and his girlfriend swiping a car from a valet parking and going for a joy ride. It turns out that they are telling their story to a couple of friends and that is pretty much how this movie is told.

It begins more or less right away with some nice action and it continues that away with plenty of action sequences intermixed with story telling. The action and martial arts is really good in my opinion. They are in stark contrast to the mediocre rubbish we were treated to in Snake Eyes. The latter which was quite a disappointment.

This movie relies heavily on fantasy elements with tie ins to Doctor Strange, especially towards the end. Another movie that I liked a lot by the way. Thus there are of course plenty of special effects and CGI. Most of them good or very good. I really liked the beautiful world of Ta Lo. The combat scenes, especially when the rings are in action are both cool and beautiful.

There are quite a lot of comical relief in the movie as well and, for once, it is not to silly, outrageous or plain stupid. It contributes well to the enjoyment factor of the movie. The washed out actor is a bit on the limit but otherwise it works well with the rest of the movie. That guy on the bus starting to film and make commentaries was quite hilarious for instance.

The story? Well it is a Marvel special effects movie so one should not expect too much but the story is not bad. It mostly holds together and works well enough to tie all the action together. The acting is pretty much the same thing. One should not expect too much but it is good enough. It was nice to see Michelle Yeoh as Ying Nan though. She was one of the few cool characters in Discovery and she does know how to act.

Overall I very much enjoyed this movie. It is a simple super hero and fantasy adventure story with lots of action and special effects and with the single purpose of entertaining the audience that doesn't fall in the trap of trying to ""educate"" said audience.","I have to say that this was a surprisingly good movie.

491,491,Surprisingly entertaining for MCU's 4th phase,"Now that we're finally into the fourth phase of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, we're getting to see the deep cuts from everyone's favorite superhero community. Despite having an unnecessarily long title, 'Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings' is a fun ride that doesn't feel like a retread of Marvel films past.

The introduction to Shaun (Shang-Chi, portrayed by Simu Liu) is handled well, as the character is likable and feels like a good fit among the established members of S. H. I. E. L. D. Comic relief comes in the form of Awkwafina's Katy - sidekick to Shaun - and an atypical showing by Sir Ben Kingsley, while more serious performances are delivered by veteran actors Tony Chiu-Wai Leung and Michelle Yeoh.

As for the plot, it can almost be split in two, as the first and second halves of 'Shang-Chi' feel like completely different films. The first half is very unserious and comes off as a companion to the latest 'Spider-man' entries, whereas the second half is a more traditional Marvel action-drama. Even though there are plenty of typical superhero tropes thrown in here with even more of a Disney imprint than past MCU movies, it's still enjoyable for what it is.

The somewhat surprising strength of 'Shang-Chi' suggests there's no slowing down in the MCU film factory.","Now that we're finally into the fourth phase of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, we're getting to see the deep cuts from everyone's favorite superhero community.

492,492,Sort of disappointed..,"I got to admit I wasn't particularly blown away by anything in the movie.. I might even say ""I was bored"" by it.

Don't get me wrong.. it IS a spectacle! The action is great. The locations are nice, costume design, sound design, etc. But it is overall a soft release not worth seeing in theaters.. specially as a follow-up to what Endgame was.

The biggest problem for me, is how the underwritten lead has muddled personality (for reasons covered in the story) devoid of charm, personality or good dialogue.

The next issue is the humor, which didn't land for me.. Not once. The supporting lead Awkwafina isn't her normal ""loud"" self that's supposed to be funny every time she opens her mouth. Her role is very supportive and a little dramatic. And while I questioned myself why was she even there for, it doesn't ultimately matter. She is another forgettable character that is given more importance than the role deserves.

Finally, the third act is weak. There's a balancing problem with stakes. You can't feel tension or weight to any action. And there's a lot of superficial ""I can't do it"" until they can.

In the end, this feels like a very safe plot, written in a way to appeal to china (considering how the Mandarin is portrayed), that ends up appealing to no one specific. Certainly doesn't feel like a Marvel movie.. but it was bound to happen if we are to be introduced to different aspects of the narrative. But it also doesn't feel like a comic book. It's more generic than that.","I got to admit I wasn't particularly blown away by anything in the movie.. I might even say ""I was bored"" by it.

494,494,Bold & Brilliant,"A bold step for the MCU, incorporating an Eastern cinema approach into it's franchise. With it's foundations built on choreography and humour, Shang-Chi beautifully brings in elements of famed Kung-Fu films and Chinese culture.

The cast, perhaps largely unknown in most of the world, perform excellently and those performances are centred on the movements within the film. Taking inspiration from many martial arts, the action scenes - whilst exaggerated and outlandish in comparison to the film's peers - are brilliant. The addition of Kingsley is truly excellent too, as he and Awkwafina provide the majority of laughs.

A standalone plot whilst maintaining links to the MCU, Shangi-Chi creates a new platform for Marvel to explore, although clearly sets up the next Phase along with other releases from the year. The standout element is the creation of the new world and it's creatures though, a huge Disney budget bringing to life fabled animals long deserving of a spotlight.","A bold step for the MCU, incorporating an Eastern cinema approach into it's franchise.

The cast, perhaps largely unknown in most of the world, perform excellently and those performances are centred on the movements within the film. Taking inspiration from many martial arts, the action scenes - whilst exaggerated and outlandish in comparison to the film's peers - are brilliant. The addition of Kingsley is truly excellent too, as he and Awkwafina provide the majority of laughs.

A standalone plot whilst maintaining links to the MCU, Shangi-Chi creates a new platform for Marvel to explore, although clearly sets up the next Phase along with other releases from the year. The standout element is the creation of the new world and it's creatures though, a huge Disney budget bringing to life fabled animals long deserving of a spotlight."
495,495,Shang Chi and the legend of the ten rings,,
496,496,The Master of Kung-fu,"Shang chi and the legend of the ten rings we follow the story of a guy named Shang(Simu Liu) who lives your basic life In San Francisco. Working as a Valet parking car, and partying late nights with his best friend Katy(Awkwafina). Until one day a band of assassins targets Shang and it's revealed that he's actually an assassin trained at birth by his father Wenwu(Tony Leung Chiu-Wai). The leader of the ten rings an ancient Chinese organization that's existence for thousands of years, conquering kingdoms and overthrowing governments. Now Shang-Chi must faces his father and overcome the demons of his past. Each of these Marvel films I find most enjoyable is the world building, set up of this universal series. All these characters from various backgrounds and classes and worlds. Shang-Chi I can say is one of those welcome new additions. Similar to Guardians of the galaxy when this was announced I hadn't the slightest idea who this guy was. Usually when people think Martial artists with marvel they usually think Iron fist or daredevil. So going into this I had a blank expectation of what to see. It does pay tribute to old-school martial arts films while mixing fast action charm of a comic book with a blend of Chinese mythology and philosophy. It does helps gives the movie an identity and the characters overall I found them good not great, but I found them entertaining and likable. Shang's more or less just an ordinary guy just trying to live his life. Have fun make a new start and make the best of it. He's honestly more or less happy with his basic life. Though at the same time running from his old life his father,mother and sister. It all leaves an impact on him as a person. He's pretty emotional not Peter Parker emotional, but he still has a personality outside of just having a stoic Shaolin fighter serious persona. They could have easily done a chosen one theme with him that been done to death. He likes to joke and have fun along with his friend Katy. Awkwafina I'm not a fan of her I didn't really care for her in crazy Rich Asians or Raya and the last dragon. Here I found her character more funny and likable. She doesn't really come off as that annoying friend that's more or less in the way. Her and Simu do play well off each other and display this friendship of two different people who still very similar. I got sort of Rush hour vibe off them, there's even a fight scene outside on a bamboo scaffolding. She's not just a pointless tagalong she does have moments where the jokes don't work , though she does add to the film specifically in the finale. The tone of the movie still finds time to flesh them out. More or less the two of them are just goofballs at the beginning, once more's revealed it does take time to have it's more deep serious moments. Wenwu I found to be a really good villain and While technically this still isn't really the Mandarin that comic readers we're probably expecting. His overall character is very compelling he more borders the line like killmonger. You understand his reasons though his actions are unjustifiable. He does still manages to gives off this somewhat opposing demeanor not from his fighting, but from the way he present his self. I buy this guy used to be a tyrant and a Conqueror. I still wish his rings worked the same way though, really he just throws them like chakra and whips them around. As for the sister she's given minimal in this not really alot of moments. Outside of her childhood flash backstory it's clear later down the road their gonna do something her. The visuals are stunning to this one water effect the just pops off the screen. The use of elements being shown through the right use of slow motion. The landscape of Tao lo which has this very traditional Chinese style with Nine-tail foxes, and Fu dog(lions) that make that the rhinos from black panther looks bad. I want to see more places like this in future installments. A lot of these cg effects are on par with doctor strange.","Shang chi and the legend of the ten rings we follow the story of a guy named Shang(Simu Liu) who lives your basic life In San Francisco.

497,497,Simply entertaining,"When shang chi was announced in phase 4, i got excited because i am a fan of martial arts films. But after the pandemic, i slowly started losing interest in the film because i felt that mcu won't be as good after endgame and my fear turned true with the post endgame movies. None of the films or series satisfied me. I saw shang chi with low expectations and got fully satisfied.

What i loved about shang chi the most was its entertaining. Post endgame, mcu got burdened with expectations to connect their films into a universe, set up future films and do something different but in that process forgot to provide entertainment. On the other hand, shang chi is not burdened with any of these and tells a simple and independent story. There is no deliberate connecting to the mcu, nor they are in a hurry to set up any sequels, also its not anything different as its a typical Chinese martial arts mythological film. The action scenes in train and skyscraper were mindblowing and best hand to hand action scenes after winter soldier(which black widow failed to provide). The female stars were also badass. The climax cgi action was okay.

Only drawback is there is nothing new in the plot as its that typical mcu storyline where our hero has daddy issues.

On the whole, shang chi and the legend of ten rings is a very good standalone mcu film after thor ragnarok.","When shang chi was announced in phase 4, i got excited because i am a fan of martial arts films.

498,498,Exciting and heartwarming,,
499,499,A diverse new addition,"Shang Chi and the Legend of the Ten rings is one of the marvel's first phase 4 movies. In hindsight it has a underlying tone and story similar to that of Black Panther. Both being representations of certain groups and and their cultures.

The story is solid. It wasn't perfect as it had some minor flaws. A bit cheesy with good writing and comedy but nothing exceptional. The fight scenes , the choreography and dragons were cool which were refreshing compared to the last couple of MCU movies that were released. The characters are nothing to interesting other than Shang Chi and his dad and their whole dynamic.

Overall an enjoyable film. An eyecandy with some flaws but nonetheless was watchable and likable.

Fast paced, energetic, and relentless, not particularly the genre I normally go to, or enjoy, but I loved every second of it, a visual masterpiece. Superb acting, terrific musics, but it's produced in such a magical way, it is stunning.

504,504,Precious ... ten times,"Of course I am just riffing off, teasing and making fun of certain things with my summary line. Though there is some truth in there too - especially if you consider the last third of the movie - quite fantastical, pun intended.

But there is so much more here. And while you may have seen the bus scene already (I imagine many times), it still is quite the highlight and works wonders! Because there is even more to it than the trailer/teaser revealed! As is with the plot and the characters of the movie.

I was able to watch it on an Imax screen and let me tell you ... wow! But also wow and much respect to Marvel and Feige and anyone involved that they dared to make the first ten minutes or so in chinese! And throwing a lot of chinese terms (slang?) in there as well - throughout! That gives it a touch of authenticity. How immigrants in America or anywhere else in the world grew up. I do the same with my Greek and German/English.

It is also nice and while I am prone to be sarcastic, I really think it's a good thing to have such a major and big representation - especially nowadays with Anti-Asian hate/crime rising. All because of people blaming China and people of China for a virus ... the movie does not have that as a topic, it is entertainment after all, but in every promo and interview that the actors were involved it was something that was mentioned. Good for them and good for us, that this was made.

I am a bit biased when it comes to the MCU and this did get a pure theatrical release, instead of the Black Widow treatment (which also was available on Disney plus and the cinemas at the same time). So there is not issue when it comes to that. And if you can watch it on the big screen - you will not be dissapointed! Now waiting for the other stuff to drop ... especially after the mid credit scene, that is such a tease ... the after the credits scene might also hint at something, but the bigger tease was midway through the credits (actually almost at the beginning of them to be honest).

Sit back and enhoy the movie and the really funny characters ... and quite a few familiar faces. Some from the MCU and previous entries but also some from Asian cinema! Well done!","Of course I am just riffing off, teasing and making fun of certain things with my summary line.

506,506,Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,,
507,507,The best Marvel movie so far...,"Having seen the trailer for the 2021 Marvel action movie ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" I must admit that of course I was going to watch it, but I feared it would just be another run-of-the-mill-over-the-top-CGI-fest-but-barred-of-proper-contents Marvel movie. Yet, I opted to sit down and watch it, on the notion that it was a Marvel movie. But also because of the cast that starred in it.

And yeah, this movie was over the top in terms of CGI. Of course it was, because it is a Marvel movie after all. But luckily this movie broke the formula of the archetypical Marvel movie and this actually turned out to be the best Marvel movie so far. Well, at least in my opinion. Why? Well, because of the storyline and the fact that it mixed Asian culture and lore into the Marvel cinematic universe, and it was a much needed addition to an otherwise Western-focused series of movies.

The storyline told in ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"", as written by Dave Callaham, Destin Daniel Cretton and Andrew Lanham was certainly entertaining. And the movie didn't really have a dull moment, despite the fact that it was a movie that ran for 132 minutes. I thoroughly enjoyed the entire movie from beginning to end. And for me, this was a storyline with proper contents to it, that also included interesting characters and creatures.

Visually then ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" blew me away. The CGI team really worked their magic with this movie and brought it to life in a very visually fulfilling way. Lots of nice details and jaw-dropping special effects. And the creature designs in the movie were off the charts, I really enjoyed seeing those brought to life on the screen.

The character gallery in ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" was interesting, and that applies for both the villain and good guy side.

And they had such a great cast ensemble put together for ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"", with the likes of Asian cinema heavy weighters such as Tony Chiu-Wai Leung, Michelle Yeoh and Wah Yuen. But the movie was also nicely carried by Simu Liu, whom I was not familiar with prior to this movie. And also having Awkwafina in the movie was just brilliant, because she put on a spot on performance with her comedy sidekick character. And it was interesting and nice to see Ben Kingsley return to reprise his character of Trevor Slattery.

""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" is a good combination of action and narrative storytelling, which made for a very wholesome movie. And it should be said that the action sequences were breathtaking to behold, so very, very nicely choreographed and executed on the screen, taking that traditional Wuxia elements seen in Asian movies and mixing it in with the archetypical Marvel Western-based superhero movies.

I was more than genuinely entertained by ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" and it is certainly a movie that bolsters Marvel's hold for me, as their movies tend to be super flashy with spectacular effects, but rather hollow in terms of proper entertainment and storytelling.

My rating of ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" lands on a well-deserved nine out of ten stars.

510,510,Indeed legendary,"It's been ten years since Shang-Chi(Liu, charming, stoic) last saw his father, and leader of the criminal empire The Ten Rings, Wenwu(Leung, charismatic enough that we feel a lot of empathy for him, even when he does terrible things that we desperately want him to stop doing). That was also when he last spent time with his sister, Xialing(Zhang, a badass who deserves more screen time. Honestly, I'd be very surprised if she didn't, in future projects). He's joined by his friend Katy(Awkwafina, quirky, providing a lot of comic relief, something I'm told she's in general adept at), for what can best be described as a tense reunion, which allows the movie to really mine the family melodrama, one of the best elements it has. I won't give away exactly what the antagonist intends to do, only that our hero has to stop him. However, he has to figure out how, maybe even if, that is even possible.

Not quite, yet almost ""Black Panther for Asian audiences"", this does a lot for representation(including for women. Some of the best characters in this are female. In addition to the two that I've already mentioned, there is also Ying Nan(Yeoh, wise)), it is positively drenched in Chinese culture(the third act, while in ways it feels like it belongs to a completely different film than the first two, takes an especially deep dive into that. Ultimately, it is presented through a Western lens, and clearly we need to go further in this direction, still, it is a big deal that they put so much of it in an estimated $150 to 200 million major blockbuster, which will be seen by millions of people who would never consider watching an art picture, especially one focusing on a group they don't belong to), to the point where countless times, when it makes sense, major characters in this speak Mandarin to each other, rather than English, which it is subtitled into. And ""don't worry"", for those who think that the following is important: there are white people on screen, and they aren't made out to be ""less than"".

The action(each sequence of which feels distinct, belongs with the rest, and is memorable) pays tribute to many different kinds of martial arts films, acknowledging that they are standing on the shoulders of giants. Jackie Chan, wuxia, etc. The choreography is matched in skill by the cinematography. Not only are we seeing incredible fighting, the camera is dynamic, celebrating and highlighting how incredible it is. That *is* why you hire Bill Pope, the director of photography on the Matrix trilogy, two of Sam Raimi's Spider-Man entries, Darkman and Team America. The special effects are excellent. There are some issues with pacing, and certainly a chunk of this is composed almost entirely of flashbacks.

This features relatively brief but highly concentrated, surprisingly graphic gore(you know, there was a time when the fact that it's happening to beings that clearly are not human, wasn't enough to get away with this kind of thing with a PG-13 rating. Pepperidge Farm remembers), as well as a little strong language. I recommend this to any fan of comic book movie adaptations, and people passionate about diversity hiring. 8/10.","It's been ten years since Shang-Chi(Liu, charming, stoic) last saw his father, and leader of the criminal empire The Ten Rings, Wenwu(Leung, charismatic enough that we feel a lot of empathy for him, even when he does terrible things that we desperately want him to stop doing).

It was that good in my humble opinion. Visually it was just stunning, great CGI's, very well choreographed fighting scenes, and a story that was most entertaining to watch. Some might find it over the top but it's a Marvel so what do you expect? To me this is one of Marvels best movies yet if not the best. The acting was good as well, and that from the whole cast. I never heard of Shang-Chi before but from now he has one more fan. Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings won't disappoint a lot of people, unless you're just not into this genre of movies. A must see for the fans.","Without spoiling anything as this story stands by itself there's going to be a sequel and I really look forward to that. It was that good in my humble opinion.

513,513,great start but the fictionary world didn't fit in for me,"Started like a mix between martial art and the marvel universe. I found it something special and liked it a lot just until the journey starts and another world opens. From there on we came into a fiction world with dragons and monsters.

It's there that this flick lost my attention towards the story. It takes a while before the action comes back in. But once the fights are on, the effects are really stunning.

It's there that this flick lost my attention towards the story. It takes a while before the action comes back in. But once the fights are on, the effects are really stunning.

515,515,A Marvel for the whole family.,"""The US government was almost toppled by a pretender named after an orange."" Wenwu (Tony Leung)

This quote is typical of the light-hearted but also serious addition to the MCU that is Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings. Although Marvel has always been less serious than DC, this time it leaves Superman and Batman to cry in their capes. Sweet superhero Sean/Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) has more humanity than almost any other hero, and he uses his martial arts only when pressed.

The opening sequence on a bus (you can see the bad coming from other cinematic bus rides such as in Nobody) is rousing and entertaining. It has a fight sequence I laughed through because of its ballet-like composition but satisfying because it sets up character and motivation.

When things get heavy, and they do because Sean must confront and potentially kill his 1000-year-old mobster dad, Wenwu, Awkwafina's Katy, Sean's girlfriend, is there with amusing one-liners throughout the adventure, right down to a life-saving shot in the big ending battle scene.

Director Destin Daniel Cretton deftly orchestrates his fights and his characters' lines with the authority of a much more seasoned filmmaker. He never loses sight of the central motif-the affirmation of family primacy, so that the potential chaos of a giant cast and multiple plot strands hosts a unity glued by character and dialogue.

Shang-Chi is a Marvel for the whole family and especially the cinephiles curious how The Marvel Cinematic Universe can be so diverse, so entertaining, and so perfect a purveyor of our heroic fantasies.","""The US government was almost toppled by a pretender named after an orange.""

517,517,The legend of the ten Marvel movies a year for all eternity.,"'Shang-Chi And The Legend Of The Ten Rings (2021)' is, essentially, exactly what you expect it to be. Not only does it feel like a Marvel movie, it feels like a literal Disney movie as well. This is often detrimental to the overall affair, as the piece should have been much more unique than it ultimately is, and it makes for a much less interesting watch overall. However, the formula it follows has provided plenty of success in the past; this time is no exception. Its highs are where you'd expect them to be, as are its lows, and there is an undeniable sense of fun, albeit cookie-cutter fun, to be had. The film is an entertaining action adventure that follows a young man whose criminal father calls him and his sister back home in order to lay siege to the mystical village he believes is holding his wife, the protagonist's mother, hostage. The villain's motivation is a little underexplored yet entirely understandable. It comes from a believable emotional place and is more satisfying because of it. The relationship between the lead and his no-good dad isn't explored as much as it could be, though, and the flick generally has a bit of a theming issue. The piece tries to tie its events directly into the wants and needs of its lead characters, but it does so in an unsatisfyingly half-baked way and honestly would probably have been better if it played itself as more of a straightforward adventure ala most of the 'Mission: Impossible (1996-)' series. Still, the touches of character development are appreciated and each lead player is written to be as likeable as possible. This, combined with the amicable performances, means that you care about the heroes even though you don't have all that much reason to. This keeps you invested in their stories throughout. The highlight of the entire affair is, for sure, its action. For the most part, the picture stays towards the right end of the practical to CG spectrum. The fights are never exactly realistic, per se, but they're based on competent choreography and clean camerawork. They're, more often than not, really entertaining. Sadly, the flick inches closer and closer towards the wrong end of the aforementioned spectrum the longer it goes on. By the time it reaches its finale (which gives me major 'Fast And Furious Presents Hobbs And Shaw (2019)' vibes for some reason), it's clear that the balance it previously achieved is going to go out of the window. Sure enough, its climactic battle is an entirely computer-generated affair; it isn't all that compelling and goes directly against what made the movie so enjoyable to begin with. No matter how hard it tries to disguise it, it still ends with a big blue beam in the sky. Still, the finale isn't exactly bad. It's just annoyingly intangible and feels a little forced in, even (as do the rather cringe-worthy post-credits scenes). Ultimately, this is a generic yet entertaining experience. Its charming acting and exciting action are clearly its highlights, and its weakest aspects are still decent enough. It's a good movie. However, I can't deny that Marvel fatigue is becoming more and more pertinent in my mind. You know what you're going to get before you get it. Plus, the studio's insistence that it has to perforate every single outing with references to other, almost entirely irrelevant fare is really annoying. Although most of their movies are at least okay, I find myself not caring at all about them. That's sad, really, considering that the MCU has produced some genuinely great pictures in the past. 7/10.","'Shang-Chi And The Legend Of The Ten Rings (2021)' is, essentially, exactly what you expect it to be.

518,518,Fun martial arts action-comedy with some dragon ex machina,"After a flashback, this movie jumps to a couple of slackers, Shaun and Katy, with Shaun proving during a wild bus ride that he is much more than a car attendant. Soon they're on a globe hoping adventure with world-saving dimensions.

The martial arts choreography is terrific, from the opening forest fight through that fantastic bus bit to the final hand-to-hand battle (followed by the big special effects battle seemingly required in every Marvel film). Fights are funny and exciting and that final battle is truly suspenseful.

The cast is also excellent. Awkwafina is as funny as ever, Michelle Yeoh and Tony Leung bring all their seasoned expertise to their roles, and the actors are don't know are also first rate.

Although ... in the case of Simu Liu, who plays Shaun/Shang-Chi, I have no strong opinion. He's a pleasant every man who handles the action scenes well but seems less mythic hero than ""genial best friend of the main character."" With all the other talent on screen he doesn't manage to leave much of an impression, but on the bright side I don't object to him.

The story is fun, the movie does a good job of mixing humor, action, and tragical reminiscences the pace is terrific, and man there are some great fights.

519,519,my eyes couldn't handle the sheer awesomeness on the screen,"Watch this in IMAX!!!! The entire movie has an expanded aspect ratio. You're watching about 70% of the image on normal screens, plus on way smaller screens with worse speakers. I promise, it's worth it

WOWOWOWOWOW. This movie blew me away. I love it. A LOT. From beginning to end. Everything. I walked out of the movie so hyped, silent-screaming under my mask as i walked to the car. It's been a while since i walked out of a movie this happy. I have so much to say.

I love the MCU (a lot), but there are a few things that are frequently lacking. One of them is good fight scenes. They always have awesome action scenes, but specifically fight scenes are usually pretty good, only great in a few movies like civil war and winter soldier. And in general, fight scenes in American movies pale in comparison to Asian cinema (Ip man, The Raid Redemption, anything Jackie Chan).

The fight scenes in this movie.... how do i describe it... amazing martial arts that's fast but clear, filmed in creative and astonishing ways without a hint of shaky cam or quick cuts, against stunningly beautiful backdrops... phenomenal. And they continuously focus on the fights instead of cutting to a different scene after 10 seconds like i've noticed in the MCU.

This is BY FAR the best fighting in the MCU and it's not even close. Has to be up there with the John Wick series and Netflix's Daredevil as some of the best we've seen in America lately. I loved the first major fight scene so much that i was worried it would be the best one of the movie, far too early. Lol. I be stupid sometimes

Another frequent flaw in the MCU is lack of compelling villain. Nope. Awesome awesome awesome. That's all i'll say.

Another of my frequent complaints is that the musical scores, with some exceptions, don't stand out. I think they heard. They're on a good streak with the shows and Black Widow. It's not as amazing as the Loki score but i liked it. It felt unique to this new franchise.

Still so much more to say, need to go faster. This is one of the best, maybe THE best, story in the MCU, especially the way it's told. I loved all the characters, i loved all the casting choices, i loved the performances. There are scenes of dialogue that gave me goosebumps. All the emotional moments hit. All the callbacks hit. There isn't anything that didn't work for me. There's no such thing as a perfect movie, but mannnnnn.

Lmao i didn't mention the cinematography. Why would i wait this long? It's MESMERIZING. A lot. Throughout. It's candy for your eyes.

It's also nice to see well-written comedy with jokes relevant to the scene and characters, that feels organic. As opposed to the ""insert joke here"" method we've been seeing more of, especially in Far From Home.

What's the opposite of formulaic? That's this movie. I never knew what to expect next (helps that i didn't watch a single trailer, they ruin movies). Definitely doesn't feel like a typical MCU movie. It has it's own unique tone and feel and character.

Continuing what i said in my headline, i have this thing where i get goosebumps and start tearing up, not from an emotional moment, but from a scene being so incredible, especially action scenes. Don't know why it happens, don't know if it happens to other ppl. Maybe it's partly because i can't risk blinking. That happened in this movie numerous times. Like ""this is the coolest thing i've ever seen in my life."" hyperbole, but mannnnn

after endgame finished phase 3 (yes i know spider-man), i was so happy and satisfied with the MCU. But i wasn't sure they could ever recapture that magic again. I knew i would watch everything and it would probably mostly be awesome. But i wasn't expecting top-tier stuff any more. Lol. I be stupid sometimes. I am ecstatic to have that notion obliterated. As of now, this is a top 6 MCU movie for me. Wow

All in all, i adore this movie. You may wonder why i wouldn't give it a 10 after all this raving. 10s are super rare for me, only 13 of them, and i watch thousands of movies. Interstellar, inception, mad max fury road, etc. Movies that shouldn't even be called movies. My 9s are rare too, they are my favorite movies. 10s are my favorites of my favorites. Only superhero movies i've given 10s are dark knight, dark knight rises and civil war.

If you're still reading, wow you're awesome! I think this is my longest review other than Interstellar.

I'm still in such a good mood. I can't wait to watch it again, in IMAX. I want to wait a week so it feels fresher, but i might not be able to!

""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" (2021) is definitely one of my favorite Marvel movies. I loved fighting scenes - this is first ting what separated this movie from the bunch. Also i liked the story (i haven't read comics). Acting was good by everyone. Action scenes (and there are plenty of them) were simply amazing. This is a one spectacular looking movie.

Overall, superbly paced at running time 2 h 5 min this movie never dragged. Special effects were amazing, as well as technical stuff of this movie including terrific cinematography. ""Shang-Chi"" is a superbly entertaining popcorn escapism.","Greetings from Lithuania.

Here we go...

I'm not feeling this movie. It starts with promise but It lost me after Wong vs Abomb.

The fighting is exciting. The movie lacks excitement though. It's a plain dull movie.

It's about a Karate master and... yeah the movie lost me and I have know idea what it's about. This is the first mcu film that I lost interest for midway. Even Im3 wasn't so bad because I lost interest from the very beginning.

Gotg2, mcu Spiderman 1/2 and IM3 are still the worse in mcu. Shang Chi just joined the club.

A movie so full of emptiness that it makes an empty box jealous

I'm not sure how this is a 7. Fans and the average movie goer should also be held responsible for horrible movies.

This movie ain't a 7 even if you watched this movie as blind and drunk.

They tried to be funny by having Wong be rude by drinking the couple's drink at the end credit scene. That wasn't funny at all. Wizard or not.

Speaking of funny, I didn't laugh once. When I used to watch these movies in theatres, the audience often told me when I should have laughed. I watched it at home, therefore I didn't know my cue of when to laugh.

The mcu needs to chill with the daddy issue plot

THOR Loki daddy issue Black Panta daddy issues Stark Daddy issues Star lord Daddy issues Ultron daddy issues Nebula and Gamora daddy issues Shang daddy issue Wasp daddy issues Scott langs daughter Daddy issues

No one has mommy issues.

Don't watch this movie.","Sorry for the delay.

I have to admit that I had my doubts about this movie but I was proven very wrong since it's an amazing movie. It has a beautiful and very interesting plot that keeps you in tense through its whole duration consisted of plenty of action and nice CGIs. For one more time Marvel succeeded on creating a nice atmosphere and connecting the previous movies with this one with many Easter Eggs so, we expect more in the near future. The interpretation of Simu Liu who played as Shaun / Shang-Chi was simply outstanding and he made the difference. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Tony Chiu-Wai Leung's who played as Xu Wenwu, Michelle Yeoh's who played as Ying Nan, Meng'er Zhang's who played as Xialing and Awkwafina's who played as Katy. The comic relief role of Ben Kingsley as Trevor Slattery was a brilliant idea that also gave something different in the movie. Finally, I have to say that ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" is an amazing movie and I strongly recommend everyone to watch it, especially the fans of Marvel.","""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" is an Action - Fantasy movie in which we watch a new era of Marvel Studios rise with Shang-Chi, the master of Kung Fu.

536,536,"Epic, stunning, and a strong powerhouse story.","5 out of 5 stars.

Shang-Chi and the legend of the Ten Rings is an awesome and exciting mcu film that brings the stunning world with the asian culture. I will say i enjoyed this more than the previous mcu film Black Widow. Shang Chi introduces a new mcu character played by Simu Liu. And Awkwafina which is also a fun addition. While they are being chased by an organization called ten rings. Lead by his father Tony Leung. While Shang Chi learns his abilities and the ten rings. Before his father is trying to use that power for a personal reason.

Great epic plot. Shang Chi and Katy (Awkwafina) enter a hidden world Ta Lao where there is magical mythical creatures. Is like a wow stunning moment when you first see Wakanda in Black Panther. The film does give an emotional story build up and a villain that can be relatable.

The cast ensemble is great. Simu Liu did great with the character along with Awkwafina as his friend. Meng'er Zhang, Michelle Yeoh, Benedict Wong, Florian Munteanu, and Tong Leung all did great.

The set designs and visual effects are stunning and great. Can be colorful at moments. The music score was good as well. The action sequences are great and exciting. Every set piece had an awesome martial arts choreography which was well shot with the cinematography. Director did a great job in capturing the action and fight sequences. Even with the epic climax of the dragon battle.

There are two mid and post credit scene which sets up for further films and has a fun nod to the mcu.

I will say Shang Chi is a great exciting addition and i found the film to be very fast moving. Action packed. And a great family conflict story that is emotionally driven.","5 out of 5 stars.

537,537,A Marvel-ous martial arts joy,"Showing no signs of slowing down hot off the heels of Black Widow, a raft of well-received Disney+ series and arriving not too far in front of the hotly anticipated The Eternals, Marvel continues to put in work that puts many other wheelhouses too shame, with the marital arts infused Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, yet another entry into the brands increasingly loaded catalogue of quality blockbuster releases.

It's hard to pinpoint exactly what Marvel keep doing to maintain the momentum that started all those years ago with 2008's Iron Man, it's absolutely correct when many say a lot of these origin stories and event pictures follow a very set formula from A to B, but with an ability to attract some of the best actors working in the industry today and handpicking a raft of some of the most exciting Hollywood filmmakers around, Marvel have once more struck gold with the incredibly fun and inventive Shang-Chi.

Quite possibly the most visually sumptuous Marvel film yet, sometimes feeling as if Marvel has meet with Ang Lee/Yimou Zhang and in my mind the Marvel film that features the best choregraphed action scenes yet from the spectacle heavy brand, Shang-Chi is a big screen blast that is freshly directed by the upcoming Destin Daniel Cretton who here has got his just rewards after his great debut Short Term 12 and the sadly undervalued The Glass Castle came before this big-budgeted ride.

Infusing his film with a great energy and charm that is enhanced by the work of leads Simu Liu (in a career launching turn) as our likable hero Shaun/Shang-Chi, Awkwafina (doing her usual but fun schtick) as Shaun's bestie Katy and Tony Leung as the unfortunate villain of the piece Xu Wenwu, Cretton has turned out to be the perfect choice to start off the cinematic journey of the fist swinging Shang-Chi and helps instill in his film some nice differences to what we've come to expect from comic book blockbusters of the modern era.

Most notably for the film is the exciting use of hand to hand combat that is delivered spectacularly in two stand out sequences on board a moving bus and then bettered alongside a high rise building in Macau, both these set pieces are easily some of the most noteworthy of any Marvel film yet while also benefiting the film other than its Asian infused eccentricities is the fun relationship between Shang-Chi and Katy than never bothers with adding extra baggage to add weight to their believable and fun friendship.

If there was a major drawback to Shang-Chi's many wins it is in an overdrawn finale, a major problem many have acknowledged previously when it comes to Marvel films, Cretton and his team can't quite stick the landing for Shang-Chi with it being a little too long in the tooth for its own good and slightly overblown and while it features some incredible imagery and technical wizardry, the films rip-roaring start and strong middle section gives way too something lesser.

Final Say -

Another huge win for Marvel who have here with the help of director Destin Daniel Cretton and his talented cast, created an instantly likable cinematic universe that provides the comic kings with one of their most unique and exciting playgrounds yet.

539,539,Yet another superb stand-alone superhero flick in MCEU's kitty.,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (2021) : Brief Review -

Yet another superb stand-alone superhero flick in MCEU's kitty. MCEU's new phase never looked so promising but their products are delivering Better than expected. That Spider Man flick in 2019, right after Endgame, changed many perceptions about Marvel's future and even though couple of their recent series like 'Wanda Vision' and 'Loki' couldn't emerge as clear winners, they have set a solid base for upcoming new stories. Shang-Chi is a new start by all means. Not only because it comes under new phase but mainly because it is a stand-alone film and with a new superhero who is more like using traditional combat methods along with ancient superpowers. When Captain America or Black Panther begun as Stand-alone films, they promised too much and thankfully fulfilled it. Shang-Chi does the same. It may not promise too much like Steve Rogers and Wakanda stories but the point where it ends surely gives us hints of new assembled version of superheroes in Multiverse. Shang-Chi, the master of unarmed weaponry-based Kung Fu, is forced to confront his past after being drawn into the Ten Rings organization. The film has major portion covered by Family values and hence, it may look predictable but does not bore at all. Yes, few scenes are outdated and too dramatic as if we are watching a Superhero Film made in 90s but let's just forget those weak points as Shang Chi has excelled in Visual spectacle. The screenplay could have been better in the second half when the big War was supposed to take place but it actually looks tiny one except for those two humongous dragons which might remind you of 'The Hobbit'. Performances by Simu Li, Awkwafina, Meng'er Zhang, Fala Chen, Florian Munteanu are fine according to less potential available for the roles. Actually, the humour and tone of these characters was great. They all looked normal people when they were not fighting and even though the film has ancient refrences, the character don't actually go too deep to become expressive. Director Destin Daniel Cretton seemed slightly off track in the beginning when he tries to humanise all the characters with that typically teenage humor but as the film goes ahead, he recovers from the childish entanglement. With super explosive climax he surely makes up for his mistakes, rather makes us forgive it. Overall, Shang Chi is another superb entertainer for Marvel Fanboys and even neutrals are gonna enjoy it.

540,540,This could've been great if it wasn't for the cheesy writing.,"The story was riddled with holes and plot issues. Since when does Awkwafina's pedestrian character all of a sudden get invited to become part of the MCU team? What's her super power... stupidity? Don't get me wrong, I love her, but her character was lazily written. Then there's the whole daddy issues dynamic - Shang is with him, then against, then with etc.. Then we have these ridiculous dragons fighting, where one scores some power crystals and becomes stronger! This is just infantile lazy writing. There was zero shock value or anything spectacular in the entire runtime, with tedious long middle acts and a bumbling third act. The jokes were cliched and not funny. The funniest parts were Ben Kingsley's character, (of whom was in this for what reasons??) and the ending to go Karaoke - which was the only time I actually cracked a chuckle. You'd think with three writers we'd have something cohesive and coherent. But instead of a Marvel superhero story, we got a Disney evil vs good with dragons thrown into the mix. It's as if they tried too hard to create the Asian version of Black Panther.

It's a shame, because the directing and cinematography were spot on, and great S/VFX - although a little overboard with the CGI i.e. Dragons. The martial arts choreography was outstanding (although again, overboard after the awesome bus scene), and the casting and performances were excellent, especially Leung, who pretty much carried the film on his shoulders. It's a 7/10 from me.","The story was riddled with holes and plot issues. Since when does Awkwafina's pedestrian character all of a sudden get invited to become part of the MCU team?

541,541,8 Rings out of 10,"For the first time in a couple of years, since 2019's ""Captain Marvel"" the MCU introduces us to a brand new hero. Simu Liu who, rather impressively, first asked for the role on Twitter brings us Shang-Chi in a film that perhaps does have some issues with it's ending, but ultimately is a fun, funny ride of the type Marvel have been perfecting for the last 13 years.

Talented, but somewhat aimless, Shaun (Simu Liu) lives in San Francisco working as a valet with his friend Katy (Awkwafina). When he's attacked on a bus, he's forced back into the world of his father, a ruthless terrorist Xu Wenwu (Tony Chiu-Wai Leung). First visiting his sister, then returning to the Ten Rings compound, Shang-Chi decides to use his skills to defend his late mothers sacred homeland against invasion from his father and for control of ten mystical arm rings, weapons that grant their owner immortality and unearthly power.

If ""Black Widow"" was considered a wobble for the MCU, despite the fact I thought that it's a perfectly fine film, then it was important to come back with something that was undeniably excellent. ""Shang-Chi"" was that. It's the perfect balance of humour and action that Marvel have established over the last few years. The action too is tweaked slightly, to more closely resemble the types of Asian led action films that we've seen previously, be that the Jackie Chan style bus fight, or the ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon""-esque flashback fight between Shang Chi's parents. There's some lovely links to the wider MCU, including a return for Benedict Wong's Wong and for Trevor Slattery, Ben Kingsley's ""Iron Man 3"" character whose masquerading role as The Mandarin was one of the MCU's most divisive moments.

It's not perfect. The ending is perhaps a little rushed and lacking a moment or two of redemption earning for Xu Wenwu, but the peaks at the future for the character, and for the 10 Rings organisation is an interesting addition, plus our first real step on what might be the route to the next big bad.

The ending is perhaps a little rushed and lacking a moment or two of redemption earning for Xu Wenwu, but the peaks at the future for the character, and for the 10 Rings organisation is an interesting addition, plus our first real step on what might be the route to the next big bad. Excellent stuff."

543,543,Finally a Chinese superhero film from Marvel,,
544,544,More of the same from the hyperactive Marvell/Disney CGI-verse,"Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) discovers that his all-powerful and millennium-old father is about to launch an attack against the magical village where Shang-Chi's mother was born in the likely mistaken belief that his wife is not dead but is rather being held captive (there is more to the plot than one sentence can sum up but what does it matter... the story is just scaffolding for the special effects). Much fighting ensues but fortunately everyone eventually learns how to 'get along' when faced with a real threat. You have seen it all before: physics-defying martial arts, monsters who look like the recently swallowed strings of LED Christmas lights, conflicted heroes with wise-cracking 'comic relief' sidekicks (an awful Aquafina and an even more awful Ben Kingsley), giant melees featuring a variety of glowing weapons (but no blood), hyper-kinetic and hyper-implausible car/motorcycle chases, and a lot of clichéd wisecracks, tough-guy dialogue, poseur slo-mo, and heroic vogueing (we're treated to the venerable three-point power landing/slide a number of times). The only novel thing the film has to offer is the excellent rendering of mythological beasts from Chinese culture; otherwise, it's an overly-long (132 minutes, which is 120 minutes too much Aquafina), derivative, repetitive, and ultimately boring entry in the bloated, jejune Micky Mouse-Marvel superhero franchise.","Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) discovers that his all-powerful and millennium-old father is about to launch an attack against the magical village where Shang-Chi's mother was born in the likely mistaken belief that his wife is not dead but is rather being held captive (there is more to the plot than one sentence can sum up but what does it matter... the story is just scaffolding for the special effects).

545,545,Promises good things for MCU's Phase Four,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings stars Simu Liu in the lead role alongside such heavy names as Tony Leung and Michelle Yeoh in this latest installment to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Liu's Shang-Chi must come to his own as the son of the legendary Mandarin (Leung), the owner of the Ten Rings.

I like this film's style most of all. Director Destin Daniel Cretton mixes Chinese wuxia settings and aesthetics with Hong Kong wire kung fu inspired action set pieces, while still keeping it feeling like a Marvel film. There's a surprising amount of callbacks and nods to the larger Marvel universe, pleasing dedicated fans, but the film is still able to stand on its own feet and introduce us to its hero.

Kudos also to the whole filming for these action scenes. Very little shaky cam or jump cuts, especially for the hand to hand scenes. Exactly as it should be. I'd dare to say that this film has some of, if not the best action set pieces in all of MCU.

One of the most thrilling and visually spectacular end battles as well, come to think of it.

Furthermore, the acting is solid, especially from Liu, Leung and Awkwafina, who plays Shang-Chi's American friend. Meng'er Zhang as Xialing, Shang-Chi's younger sister, was perhaps my only real gripe with the film. I could have used either a bit more edge to her or alternatively a lot less. Now she seemed to flipflop between relatable and aggravating.

All in all, not the best Marvel movie by any means, but that's a really high bar to clear. I can simply say that based on this, I'm very optimistic about MCU's continued future.","Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings stars Simu Liu in the lead role alongside such heavy names as Tony Leung and Michelle Yeoh in this latest installment to the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

546,546,The Master of kung fu was really good but not as good as I wanted it to be.,"It was better than the proceeding Marvel movie Black Window. More exceeding the expectations of a Marvel movie. Shang-Chi feels like the marvel movie experience is starting to get back to the normal of the theme ride Martian Scorsese believes they are (I can't disagree, just note that's what I want)

In comparison Shang-Chi is a lower level character. I am a fan of Marvel comics but got more of the references to the Marvel Cinematic Universe in this movie than to the direct comic book references. Those Marvel cinematic universe references were amazing enough to get over the fact that the obvious comic book ones went over my head. I mean this movie's connection to other movies is great fanfare that makes me love it more. So really cool cameos happen that actually move the story along.

I did like what they did with the Mandarin here but do feel they copied and paste a lot of things into the story of Shang-Chi to make a complete movie for a lower level character. From the little I know of the character he more fits into those Netflix's shows they did a few years back but change him enough to justify a blockbuster.

They did succeed in making Shang-Chi's background more fuller. The relationship between him and his father and sister was beautiful, complex and more importantly, never bored me and of course Awkafina as the comedy relief and best friend to Shang-Chi was strategic gold. The story for the background was not that full. It's really a character driven movie for without the amazing performances from a group of actors who know their stuff this story would fall short.

Note, I loved the fact that Michelle Yeoh was in this movie and that gives it a lot, but she's done way better in less effective films (but she most likely got a huge paycheck from Disney just to wave her hands around).

The special effects were good in this flick. I was impress with what was used to make the final conflict and I was convince that the dude from Kim's Convenience was a master of kung fu

Its a good movie but it did not live up to my high expectations of it. It gave me a lot of cool things but really did not give me anything I did not see before, in movies that did it better, but if it's about anything I did spend the rest of the day pretending I knew Kung fu.","It was better than the proceeding Marvel movie Black Window.

548,548,Finally a new kind of marvel story,,
549,549,An easy watch that fits into the MCU well,"A San Francisco valet finds his past catching up with him in spectacular fashion.

This is an entertaining superhero adventure story with an Asian martial arts theme and a number of entertaining scenes.

Like many introductions to superhero characters there is a bit of backstory to go through and this film does it with flashback sequences in a similar way to 'Black Panther'. These are mixed with the action, humour and unfolding narrative of the present day plot. Additionally there is some important exposition added relating to the Marvel multiverse. Personally I think everything depicted could have been done in more than one movie, and not so rushed, but that's just a personal preference. What is presented is not complicated in anyway, but very simplified, presumably so that it can be established quickly and the likes of Shang-Chi and Katy can share screens with other MCU characters as soon as possible.

The tone and general feel of the movie also reminds me of the approach taken with 'Black Panther', particularly when it focusses on a location that, like Wakanda, mixes the sights and sounds of regional culture with the sci-fi fantasy. It has obviously been written carefully so that it displays imagery associated with far-Eastern culture like martial arts, traditional costuming, rural settings, that is marketable to a Western audience, but at the same time it avoids other commonly associated negative stereotyping like exaggerated accents, sorcery, yellow peril, bad driving, and (thankfully) gong sounds. Much of this is drenched with a liberal amount of fast-talking contemporary American humour.

There are a number of highly enjoyable scenes such as the fight sequence on the bus, the various comedy moments, virtually everything that comes out of Ben Kingsley's mouth, and all the flashback scenes. The final dinner table scene is probably my favourite.

Visually as you can imagine it is beautiful and full of top drawer cinematography, editing, and technology-driven effects. For me though the spectacle goes over-the-top, particularly in the final action sequence.

Most actors are solid such as Simu Liu, Tony Leung, Meng'er Zhang, Michelle Yeoh, Fala Chen, and Benedict Wong. The standout performances for me easily are Nora Lum and Ben Kingsley who have buckets of charisma and the advantage of all the best lines.

Overall there is little to criticise, it just feels like what Martin Scorsese described perfectly in 2019 as a theme park rather than cinema.","A San Francisco valet finds his past catching up with him in spectacular fashion.

555,555,Marvel Sprinkles a Different Flavor into the MCU,"Marvel gets mystical in this mashup of the plucky, familiar MCU character and the more stoic, legend-heavy air of wuxia films. It's a fresh mix, effectively breaking the gravity of its more serious moments with a well-timed jape while lending credence and lore to a lesser-known corner of the comic kingdom, but these crossover moments sometimes test their limits. I could see more grounded viewers being turned off by the dragons and soul-sucking demons (far cry from the feasible reality of the first Iron Man, that) while serious fans of Chinese fantasy are bucked by the constant injection of loose wit and slappy one-liners.

When it's rolling, Shang Chi does manage to toe that line and deliver something appropriately new and versatile, a good reflection of both worlds. It benefits from a tight pair of central performances (Simu Liu and Awkwafina as a team of underachieving twenty-somethings) and several big, powerful action sets (the articulated bus fight might be one of the best combat scenes Marvel's ever put out) while tying in a dangling thread or two from earlier films to provide a sense of greater connection. On several occasions, however, it's guilty of being too self-indulgent and losing the narrative. It's great to see Ben Kingsley again, adding nuance to his part in Iron Man 3, but his scenes are the main offender here; excessive and distracting and way too cute.

The action is strong, the dialogue (mostly) works, the scenery looks great, but in the big picture, Shang Chi feels small-scale and disposable. Non-completionists won't miss anything crucial if they choose to skip it.","Marvel gets mystical in this mashup of the plucky, familiar MCU character and the more stoic, legend-heavy air of wuxia films.

558,558,Marvel movie by the numbers with beautiful dragons and charming locations,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is yet another movie inspired by the Marvel universe that has constantly been inspiring the cinematic world for more than a decade now. While the movie follows the usual stereotypes, it manages to stand out with its stunning special effects and locations.

The movie revolves around Shaun, a Chinese immigrant living in the United States of America who is working as a valet with his quirky friend and soulmate Katy. One day, they get attacked by a group of assassins on a bus and only just manage to survive. Shaun immediately understands that the attack must be related to his influential estranged father. Along with Katy, he decides to team up with his tough estranged sister Xialing to find out what's going on.

This film convinces on multiple levels. First of all, the acting performances are quite quirky and convincing. Especially the ladies steal the show. Awkwafina delivers the goods as curious, dynamic and funny woman that anyone would like to have as a friend. Zhang Meng'er on the other side represents a much darker character shaped by dramatic events from the past who is much more difficult to approach with her tough, relentless and independent personality.

The expensive special effects certainly deliver the goods as well. The scenes in a fantasy world, in Ancient China and in contemporary San Francisco are all equally stunning to watch. The fantastic creatures such as dragons look impressive on the big screen.

The story might be predictable but is nevertheless entertaining from start to finish thanks to steady pace and inspired execution. You will truly care about the fates of the different characters as you are watching this film.

However, this film isn't without its occasional flaws. First of all, lead actor Simu Liu simply doesn't have the charisma of the other actresses and actors involved. Casting him was a bold choice but it didn't fully pay off in my opinion.

Up next, the movie desperately tries to connect to other characters in the Marvel Universe. The appearance of Trevor Slattery played by Ben Kingsley is completely random as it only seems to be a pretext to offer some misplaced comic relief. The mid-credit scene starts in an amusing fashion but suddenly involving Bruce Banner and Carol Danvers only seems like a weak attempt to develop a hype for potential sequels. The same goes for yet another scene after the credits that evokes more questions rather than concluding the film appropriately.

At the end of the day, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is an entertaining fantasy action film of the Marvel Universe that should appeal to faithful and occasional fans alike. It's one of the better films in the franchise but perhaps Marvel should focus on quality over quantity instead of becoming a monstrous capitalistic machine that is scarier than any gigantic dragon shown in the film.","Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is yet another movie inspired by the Marvel universe that has constantly been inspiring the cinematic world for more than a decade now.

561,561,What a film!,,
562,562,"A fun time at the movies, and that's all it really needed to be","Charming and incredibly fun- Shang-Chi may not be the best Marvel has had to offer- but it is one of their better films in some time. My main problems with the film lie in the films storyline, which to be honest, is really good, but incredibly all over the place editing wise and there is just so much of it that it feels like two movies could have been made out of it. I love that we get a more in depth look at our characters, their flaws, their regrets, the tragedy in their lives- but the editing makes it feel rather out of place at times- and takes away from the impact the film could have had and its heart. That being said, the film still manages to be very enjoyable throughout. The action scenes are absolutely incredible, the look of the film incredibly well developed- something very fresh and original for Marvel studios- and the cast are all a joy to watch- especially Simu Liu and Aquafina in the lead and supporting roles. I was skeptical of Aquafina being in a Marvel movie for sure, but she really helped the film as a whole, and honestly I would love to see more of her character in future Marvel projects. The film is entertaining, despite the pacing of the film being a bit all over the place at times. It has some brilliant, elaborate special effects that you will be gawking at on the screen, and plenty of surprises that will be bound to make you smile. In the end, Shang-Chi was a fun time for a Marvel movie- something most comic-book flicks have forgotten about recently- and i'm excited what this character has to offer in future films.

My Rating: 8.6/10.","Charming and incredibly fun- Shang-Chi may not be the best Marvel has had to offer- but it is one of their better films in some time. My main problems with the film lie in the films storyline, which to be honest, is really good, but incredibly all over the place editing wise and there is just so much of it that it feels like two movies could have been made out of it.

563,563,Shang-Chi and NOT the Ten Rings -_-,"As someone that really enjoys the MCU, I'm starting to wonder if COVID may have killed it. Black Widow was a meh experience and now Shang-Chi feels like more of that rote, by the numbers repetitiveness. Yes, they add a lot of Asian elements here to bring in other groups and try and lessen the white dominance of this franchise and I appreciate that but this movie felt like it was rushing through the plot to get to the next fantastical element and in so doing really robbed those moments of any lingering significance. Not to mention, the Marvel formula felt so very pronounced. It's so obvious what's going to happen in this movie from the jump and that's disappointing.

That aside, I'm a moderate fan of older Marvel comics and... THESE AREN'T THE TEN RINGS! Normally I don't mind when the MCU makes little adjustments to the source material. Comics are weird and a lot of that stuff wouldn't translate well to film, I get that but so far they've had two big, fat whiffs on anything Mandarin related. Looking at you Iron Man 3. These things are just super generic bands with pretty underwhelming powers which is so different from the 10 rings in the comics that all do something different!

Nerd rage aside, this just felt average to me. I'll probably check it out at some point again but I'm not feeling any sort of draw to revisit it soon. It's a touch more disappointing as I work through the Disney+ Marvel shows which all feel more engaging and more creative than this. Come on, Mouse. Get it together and put some of this TV magic back on the big screen!","As someone that really enjoys the MCU, I'm starting to wonder if COVID may have killed it.

564,564,Incredible MCU origin story,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is an incredible MCU origin story that's epic, emotional and extremely thrilling whilst also connecting to the greater universe in fun and satisfying ways. It's definitely the best thing in phase 4 so far even if it's third act has some of the usual MCU problems.

Simu Liu gives an incredible and extremely charismatic lead performance whilst also having superb chemistry with Awkwafina, who is also incredible. Michelle Yeoh and Meng'er Zhang are both great and Tony Leung is amazing as one of the better villains in the MCU with plenty of backstory and depth.

Destin Daniel Cretton's direction is excellent, it's extremely well filmed and stylish with some of the best action sequences in the franchise. The fight choreography is extremely impressive and the CG is mostly strong. It's well paced and both the soundtrack and the music by Joel P. West are both fantastic.","Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is an incredible MCU origin story that's epic, emotional and extremely thrilling whilst also connecting to the greater universe in fun and satisfying ways.

Great Pacing: Shang Chi has a lot of things built into the tale as it tries to make an origin story fit so far into the movie series. With all the information, there might be worry of the pace being off, but surprisingly it is done super well. Never really dragging, but not moving a blinding pace (mostly), Shang Chi's combination tales keeps things moving but not flying over the important elements to connect with characters. The cast gets ample time to give us their backstories, piece together all the cluse of this dynamic drama puzzle, and not sacrifice on the action to come.

Character Development: The trailers may have you thinking this is a modern martial arts film, and in a sense they would be right. However, the movie takes it one step further and goes beyond the punches to instead give the characters some soul and layers compared to the legendary films of the past. Shang's life is complicated and torn between light and dark, his sister as well experiencing the drama in her own manner that parallels the main protagonist. Even the antagonist has layers far beyond what we normally get from the Marvel group, and I loved how well their lines mixed together to make this melodramatic family story fit naturally into the Marvel universe.

The Surprise Cameo: Can't say much without spoiling, but if you are like me, then you will not be disappointed who shows up in the film. Several questions are answered with this character's return and with it many laughs to be had in the manner very familiar to Marvel fans. The inclusion of this character also holds an important (albeit stretch) plot element to give a little more meaning behind it, and I loved the choices they made to include him in the big picture.

The Cultural Influence: Like Black Panther and the African Culture, Shang Chi integrates so much of the cultural values of the Asian provinces into this movie. The costumes are stunning takes on the traditional attire, bringing the past to light while also sewing in some modern styles to jazz up the outfits. Concepts of family honor, the customs to practicing Marshal Arts, and the honoring of family are well-integrated into the story and help give the predictable tale some extra Kung Fu kick. The architecture of most of the setting breathes new life to the typical cityscapes that have been made famous in Marvel, and the legends of the Ten rings scream of the Asian mythology that is seeped int heir history. I loved how well these things were merged into a Marvel tale, and though again a little predictable and flaunting, really elevated the origin story to stand out from so many others.

The CGI Finally Disney has invested in making their movies show off what the studio can do. Shan Chi and the bunch have plenty of amazing things to overuse the computer effects that the modern era loves. Special effects for the action scenes has more realism to it then Black Widow executed, the creatures you will see have a lot more polish and fluidity to their movements, and the special effects involving the ten rings are fluid and holding depth that I felt has been missing in some recent Marvel projects.

The Acting: A great part played by all members on this film, extras included, Shang Chi's cast shows that acting is not dead and characters can be utilized well. Simu Liu as the lead was fantastic, and his campaign for being in this movie could not have ended up with better results. He holds much of the prodigal martial artist, disciplined and focused to be an avid fighter capable of crushing his enemies with his style. However, he also has that troubled layer in the past to watch that helped spread his emotional spectrum. Awkwafina is still the same cooky role she always plays, but this time gets a little more balance and heroism compared to the other characters she has heralded as in the past. I loved how well she was used in this film, and how great she complemented Simu in this role. Leung brings a lot of pizazz to the character, once again giving us an antagonist with so much more than the scowl and fist, and I felt was a perfect casting to play the opponent of Shang Chi. So many other great actors and actresses in this film, but due to time restrictions I have to move on, but trust me they did well in their performances.

The Comedy: Awkwafina is often used too much for making us laugh, and Disney has struggled with forcing a lot of comedy to make it kid friendly. However, Shang Chi has taken some steps back into discipline and used the comedy well to break up the ice. Dialogue goes a long way to breaking in the laughs, with well-timed jokes and gags being the solid punch to the gut with comedy. There are several ridiculous inclusions in this film that at first seem out of place, but then roll back in to be an extravagant joke that had great set up. And the throw in references that come with it and you get a shining beacon of awesomeness that comes with this movie. It's all done so well and I was very happy with the results.

The Action: My bread and butter for most of the Marvel movies, Shang Chi delivered very well on this film's action exposé. The art of choreographed battles brings another homage to Asian culture, and with it fantastic fights that had more bite and impressive skill use then half of the Marvel cinema. It's exciting, it's dynamic, and most of the fights have a different feel to them than what you might expect. Used well in the story, there is purpose behind the inclusion of the battles and each one has a different meaning and stakes behind it than simply punching and kicking. Even more so, the strategies behind them and what is required to win, accomplishes a level of storytelling that has been lost in the modern era, so well done on that too.

A Bit More Adult: The movie is definitely showing Marvel's modernization into the 21st century, and takes a risk of making this film darker and more adult than other installments. Cursing is definitely increased in this one, with plenty of swear words filling the dialogue, but not to the point of being overdone. No F bombs, but some of the language has got a little more bite, so caution. In addition, the tone of the tale is darker, and the sunshine and rainbows of Thor, Captain America, and Guardians is left in the dust for a grittier tale, which again is a plus.

Some of the political moments: While nowhere as bad as 75% of movies today, Shang Chi does sometimes get a bit preachy with the agenda politics of the film. Taking time out to rub it in our faces with an obvious line stating, ""Look what I had to do,"" was a bit of showboating that I could have done without. Yet even this dislike is marginal, given it's very little occurring, has some nice moments that build off of it, and sometimes has a fun lesson or joke built in.

A Little More Action:

The action in this movie is great, and I loved how much of it flowed and accomplished what I was expecting of the film, and things I was not expecting. Yet there were times where a moment of fighting felt a little forced, namely the chase scenes with vehicles that seemed like an afterthought. However, the fights at the end needed some more time for me, and perhaps a little more bouncing between the battles occurring at the same time. Star Wars has done this successfully in the past, showing all manners of battling and giving you a big scope of the battle. Shang Chi has done this better than several of the Marvel films, but still had some room to give us more looks at the other characters kicking butt. The battle is lengthy enough, I'll agree to that, but a little more showing off of the other warriors would have rounded this fight to perfection for me.

The VERDICT:

Shang Chi finally made me feel like we were back into the realm of Marvel I fell in love with years ago. A cultural building world with both origin and story continuation, this hero's quest had all the makings of a fun, exciting and swift adventure we were expecting. Buried beneath the amazing fights and special effects, was a deeper movie than I had expected, using their characters well and integrating them to serve a purpose. Balanced comedy with a cultural inclusion and politics did not steal away from the main theme of the movie, and giving it that adult touch was a plus in my book, though again caution with your little ones watching it. As for limitations, I agree there is predictability and familiarity with the movie, but the fresh twist and balance helps rejuvenate the formula and add minimize the impact of the limitations for me. Though I will say a little better wider scope battle is still needed by them. Overall, my scores for this film are:

Action/Adventure/Fantasy: 9.0-9.5 Movie Overall: 8.5-9.0.","Likes

568,568,Most Mystical and Beautiful Movie In History!,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is the most mystical and beautiful movie in history! The music, the special effects and the acting all take you to another world. The film leaves you wanting a Morris of your own.

The storyline follows a young man named Shang-Chi (Simu Liu). His father is a one thousand-year-old man and conqueror nicknamed The Mandarin (Tony Leung Chiu-wai), who has only ever used the infamous and all-powerful Ten Rings for evil. When the Mandarin is set to unleash infinite evil on the universe, Shang-Chi has to stop his father.

This movie is a cinematic experience. The fighting and choreography are out of this world. The long slow motion shots make the audience feel as if they are in a video game. Simu steals the show; every fight scene is flawless with his fluid movements and it proves just how hard he worked on his character for this film. Every audience falls in love with Shang-Chi; he's funny, with perfect comedic timing and he knows the balance between peace and violence. He encapsulates what the majority of young adults feel - like not being able to find their place in the world. The movie makes fans feel as if they've known Shang for years. It has wonderful flashbacks, which give the audience glimpses of his past, his pain and how his fears have shaped who he is. The film gives a wonderful all-around scope of this character that feels like a friend we've known all our life. It makes fans excited to see Shang-Chi again. Shang and his sister Xu Xialing are an iconic duo. They're both powerful and, while there's some tension due to their past, they put everything aside and let love shine through. Xialing is a role model, officially joining the Marvel Cinematic Universe's most powerful women. Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is perfect for AAPI (Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders) representation in cinema. It represents Chinese culture powerfully, shows what it's like to be an Asian-American in modern day USA, not to mention that Simu is Marvel Studios' first Asian-American superhero. Simu and Shang-Chi are writing history while also inspiring children and fans all around the world. The film delivers on all grounds; the cameos are shocking and leave you on the edge of your seat. Trying not to shout during the two post credits scenes prove to be a challenge. By the end of the movie, I wanted to sing the song ""Hotel California"" at the top of my lungs.

This film reminds you to search for who you are and let your past guide you to who you want to be. Ever since his mother died, Shang has been trained by his father to use violence. When he arrives at his mother's village, he learns how to find peace within himself and the world around him. He learns to trust himself and to use the rings for good.

571,571,"More movies like this, please, Marvel","Thought I was feeling some Marvel fatigue after WandaVision (which started strong but ended on a bit of a whimper) and Black Widow (which wasn't terrible, but two months later I can't remember anything about it except how Florence Pugh was cool in it), but this one has rejuvenated some of my enthusiasm for the unstoppably huge MCU.

There's a satisfying origin story here, with a few small appearances from familiar characters that add spice to a host of new characters who are all quite compelling right out of the gate.

The action's great, and there's also so much of it- I liked how lots of the action felt relatively grounded by MCU standards, with neat stunt work and exciting camerawork making the action pop (it's only the final battle that gets really CGI heavy).

The humour's also more consistent than most Marvel films, with most of the jokes landing. Also cool were all the fantasy elements and creatures- they were all pretty inventive and well-executed.

I will say the one notable flaw is that there's a lot of exposition in the film's second half, but they get around that a little by having great actors like Tony Leung and Michelle Yeoh do most of the explaining (and there is a lot to explain, with this being a whole new side of the MCU and all), so it's not super noticeable.","Thought I was feeling some Marvel fatigue after WandaVision (which started strong but ended on a bit of a whimper) and Black Widow (which wasn't terrible, but two months later I can't remember anything about it except how Florence Pugh was cool in it), but this one has rejuvenated some of my enthusiasm for the unstoppably huge MCU.

There's a satisfying origin story here, with a few small appearances from familiar characters that add spice to a host of new characters who are all quite compelling right out of the gate.

573,573,Perfect,"Honestly, on all levels this movie excels! The casting is perfect. The world building is creative, beautiful and faithful to its Asian roots. The CGI and location shoots are breathtaking. The fighting is the best I've ever seen and even the training ground sequences have an exquisite grace. The action was balanced by heart. I was concerned Awkwafina would take the humour to campy lows but she truly showed she has some serious dramatic chops. She was not the comic relief! They gave that honour to the Shakespearean stage giant, Ben Kingsley, Our own, homegrown 🇨🇦 Simu Liu was perfect for the part and his performance was world class. I could go on raving but I'll conclude my feedback by saying that this is in every way as powerful a MCU solo representation of Asian culture as BLACK PANTHER was for African culture. I gathered some feedback as I left the theatre, and got ratings of 7.5 (felt it needed more MCU content), 8 (saw many of the things I have just commented on). I've read the criticism that the storytelling was choppy, but I didn't find it so. For me it was more like chapters in a book, completely working together to create a world of content and design. Upon leaving the cinema, I was going to give the movie a 9 (superb) out of 10, but after reflecting on it, I don't know what they could have done to make it better, so, I give this film a 10 (perfect) out of 10. {Superhero Action Adventure}","Honestly, on all levels this movie excels!

575,575,"Could be better, still enjoyable","As a MCU fanatic, I've been trying to get excited about the movies they have released post-Endgame, but it has been a challenge. That particular film was such a perfect finale for the series that I have struggled with the efforts to get the storyline going again. It doesn't help that they have been so scattered in topics, lacking a single core group to bring them all together. Shang-Chi is another random hero that I only knew vaguely from references in the comics, but I never read any of his books back when I was a collector. I appreciated that this film brought a new style to a MCU movie. The blending of Wuxia into a superhero story was a fun choice.

There were also quite a few great actors in this film including Tony Leung, Ben Kingsley, Michelle Yeoh, and I'd even include Awkwafina in that category. I can certainly see how some other people might struggle with Awkwafina's schtick, but I find her comedic timing to be great, and I was laughing along the whole time. However, the one major name I left out of the ""great actors"" is Simu Liu. Sadly, I found him a little bland. He was okay with the comedy, but I certainly don't see him stacking up with the legends that have come before in the MCU. Heck, Benedict Wong has only about 5 minutes of screentime in this film, but still made a greater impression on me than Simu Liu.

Digging into the story of Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, I'd say it's a fine origin story, even if it was highly predictable. This is the kind of movie where you can stay 10 steps ahead of it, and that is unfortunate. I think that's the biggest problem with the entire film, while it's fun and engaging it also feels like a rough carbon copy of things that came before. It's a movie that is emulating a number of Wuxia films from the past, but it's not as good as any of them. It's a movie that is following the tropes of a superhero origin story, and once again isn't on the level of the best of the genre. You can't fault their ambition, but their execution was lacking.

All that negativity is not to say that Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is a bad film. In fact, I enjoyed the entire time in the theater, and was genuinely invested in the story. I thought it handled the links to the MCU well, but without feeling like it had shameless pandering for the fans, or devolving into obscure references only people like myself would understand. The film had some gorgeous visuals, and created its own world in a way that managed to be both unique but still consistent with the style of other MCU movies. There were personal stakes in the film, despite the fact that the ending fell into a giant CGI battle that felt unnecessary. I can't say that Shang-Chi will rise into the upper echelon of my MCU rankings, but it's better than some that came before.","As a MCU fanatic, I've been trying to get excited about the movies they have released post-Endgame, but it has been a challenge.

577,577,Marvel's answer to Shonen Jump.,"Shang Chi is Marvel's latest blockbuster to grace the movies: and after 2020's non-existent Marvel slate, it was about bloody time we got something after the world dealt with the sars-variant and got our double shots. And now, late 2021 we can finally go back to the movies en masse, though the road to recovery's far from over.

Shang Chi is part-origin-story for a character we've never known before, part-CG-spectacle interlaced with nice kung-fu choreography in between, all in-universe expansion for Marvel's cinematic ambitions. And it makes you wonder how deeply they thought about paying reverence to everything from Bruce Lee to the Matrix, to Dragon Ball, The Last Airbender and Kung Fu Panda.

Marvel is doing its best to escape the confines of Iron Man's legacy, and this seems like an earnest start for something far-removed from the likes of Spider-Man, and so on. Also makes you wonder if Awkwafina is gonna become a major player outside the Shang Chi movies alone.

Shang Chi is the stuff you've come to expect from Marvel Studios; it's going big and it won't stop with every subsequent film here onward. Though bigger and better seems better fitted for high-concept space operas like Infinity War and Endgame than more earthbound character-driven stories.

Shang Chi's good fun, and it really succeeds in being that during its runtime.","Shang Chi is Marvel's latest blockbuster to grace the movies: and after 2020's non-existent Marvel slate, it was about bloody time we got something after the world dealt with the sars-variant and got our double shots.

578,578,Shang Chi,"Review By Kamal K

Marvels new Shang-Chi was a choreographed dance movie disguised as Kung fu with slow paced action scenes and subtle but detailed components that pull a story together a satisfying but inappropriately fast paced manner. Making the writing seem more lazy and poorly thought out, which for me took away greatly from that satisfaction.

The main gripe I have with Shang Chi is how it just so happens that the Jade neckaces show the path and time to the hidden forest path just days before another oath opens for them to go find the tao lao.

Although the comedy music, and some of the choreography for the fight scenes were good enough to give this movie a final score of 6 out of 10 score.","Review By Kamal K

This movie was very entertaining even if it had a pretty generic and predictable storyline, and special effects were fairly uneven (amazing 'MCU quality' along with pretty terrible early 2000s CGI).

583,583,A standalone ret-con of previous MCU mistakes.,"With the end of the Infinity Saga in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, there is a lot of room for new franchises to fill in the gaps left by the likes of Iron Man and Captain America. However, this means lesser-known properties like Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (2021) get their chance to shine. And while lesser-known franchises like Guardians of the Galaxy are now household names, I think it remains to be seen if Shang-Chi can truly develop its own integrated identity within the MCU.

Having somewhat botched the introduction of the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) in Iron Man 3 (2013), Shang-Chi attempts to ret-con this by insisting that the Ten Rings organization is a genuine threat to world peace. However, Marvel wants to have its cake and eat it too by including the ""Mandarin"" in this film. There are a few other loose connections to the larger MCU in this film, but they are more cameo call-outs than anything significant. Overall, Shang-Chi is its own story.

The fact that a good portion of this film's climax takes place in a mythical hidden kingdom made it feel disconnected from the MCU as a whole. Sure, other franchises within the MCU have their origin stories. Still, I felt they made it clear how they contributed to the ""whole"" of the larger arc by either introducing characters or concepts in prior MCU movies. Shang-Chi excels in its action and choreography but feels generic in the grand scheme of things as a standalone film. I'd almost wager that its sequel will be much more interesting and that those not already committed to the MCU can probably give this one a pass.

A standalone ret-con of previous MCU mistakes, I give Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings 3.0 stars out of 5.","With the end of the Infinity Saga in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, there is a lot of room for new franchises to fill in the gaps left by the likes of Iron Man and Captain America.

584,584,See Shang-Chi on the Big Screen,"The new Marvel Super Hero film, SHANG-CHI and the LEGEND OF THE TEN RINGS is the kind of film that deserves to be seen on the big screen and Writer/Director Destin Daniel Cretton (JUST MERCY) has crafted a film that earns that statement.

Based on the Marvel comic book character (of course), SHANG-CHI tells the tale of...well...Shang-Chi a financially struggling - but happy - Valet in San Francisco who has a family secret.

Writer/Director Cretton has crafted a whimsical, mythological, mystical and action packed film that settles in at the top end of the Marvel Cinematic Universe family of films.

At the center, newcomer Simu Liu (KIM'S CONVENIENCE) more than holds his own as the newest Super Hero in the MCU. He is grounded, centered and more sure than unsure as he discovers his abilities and his family's secrets. He is a worthy addition to this world of Superheroes.

Joining him is the remarkable Awkwafina (CRAZY, RICH ASIANS) as his best friend, sidekick who handles the drama comedy and action with aplomb. This film makes some smart choices with this character and Awkwafina shines.

The rest of the cast/characters are equally as strong from Tony Chi-Wai Leung (as Shang-Chi's father) to Meng'er Zhang (as Shang-Chi's sister) and good ol' Michelle Yeoh (as Shang-Chi's Aunt) bring strong characters to life. They all shine.

This film also brings back a character from a previous MCU film that somewhat redeems the poorly conceived character from his earlier appearance. I won't spoil it by saying who it is, but I liked what the MCU did with this character.

But, this being a Marvel movie, all of these performances anchor a bigger picture that is filled with action, action and more action - and something else, something mystical.

Here is where Director Cretton really shines. The action scenes are interestingly staged and choreographed well. The first fight (the bus fight that is shown in the trailer) and a fight on scaffolding both particularly work well.

This film does delve into the mystical in the last 1/3 and in Cretton's hands, this ends up working well instead of being comical or inane. I bought what was going on and was rooting for our heroes to defeat the undefeatable, fantastical creatures.

To be honest, the ""final battle"" didn't really live up to the rest of the film so that brings this film down a notch, but this movie did what it needed it to do, it opened up a whole new area of the Marvel Cinematic Universe - in both character and locations - and I am anxious to see where they go from here.

Try to see SHANG-CHI on the Big Screen, the visuals are worth it.

It is a spectacle with regards to action sequence and fighting choreography, but the film misses a solid storyline for an origin story as its titular character lacks personality and does not go through any heroic transformation story arc. Simu Liu has a strong presence as Shang-Chi, yet he is overshadowed by many of his more experienced co-stars.","Destin Daniel Cretton's 'Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings' marks a bland start to the new phase of Marvel Cinematic Universe.

592,592,Ten Rings to rule them all...,"Positives:
This is Marvel at its best. A script (with Shakespearean undertones) that melds action with good character development and laugh-out-loud feelgood dialogue. The great thing is that you don't need to be a Marvel nerd to enjoy this one. Yes, there are some fabulous Easter Eggs for Marvel fans (and a wonderful return of a character from one of the early films). But its almost a standalone feature in its own right.


The action sequences are top-notch, particularly an early fight on a careering an Francisco ""bendy-bus"". Some great martial arts reminiscent of ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", made more exciting by the fact that the impressive Simu Liu did all his own stunts.






Negatives:






Timeline?: So, it took more of a Marvel nerd than I am (my wonderful daughter-in-law Bronwyn) to point out that although this film is set (largely) in the ""Present Day"", the events of ""Avengers: Endgame"" actually happen in 2023. So in the Marvel timeline, this is set in between Thanos's ""blip"" and ""the return"". This is the reason why Wong is present but not Doctor Strange, for example.

Summary Thoughts: Marvel goes East! This is a really entertaining addition to the franchise, mixing Marvel action with Eastern mysticism and martial arts. It's an impressive job by director and co-writer Destin Daniel Cretton, in only his second feature (he did ""Just Mercy"" in 2019).

As a Marvel film, there are of course end-credit scenes (""monkeys"" in onemannsmovies speak). A mid-title one is the best, bringing some additional Marvel characters into the mix. And there's a post-credits one which sets up for further sequels but which I found rather irritating.

It's ironic that a Marvel movie so right for the Chinese market - the first to be headlined by an Asian actor and with substantial Mandarin dialogue - might not get a release in China. According to this report, this appears to be for two reasons: firstly that the actor Simu Liu made some derogatory remarks about China in the past, and secondly that in the comics Shang Chi's father is Fu Manchu - a Western-derived character with racial overtones.

This doesn't seem to have hurt it so far. After less than two weeks of opening, it has made $262 million on a budget estimated to be $150-200 million.

596,596,One of the most Emotionally Charged Superhero Movies made in recent times.,"Let's keep aside all these serious conversations about Asian Representation, Diversity and all other societal stuff for a moment and let us all just appreciate Marvel for creating one of the most (if not the Most) emotionally charged superhero movies in recent times.

I'm not even exaggerating, I have been a follower of Marvel since my teenage days, suffice it to say, Through many ups and downs I keenly witnessed all of their works over the years. Trust me when I say that they have very much revamped their strategy this time around.

Excluding their typical set-up for a Comicbook blockbuster, Shang-Chi's familial/dramatic aspects are on an all-time high here. The way this story has been told, it just feels somewhat distinctive and special (Especially, compared to the last few projects Marvel has had come up with).

Other than the apparent masteries in its Audio-Visual departments (as expected); the narrative here infuses a powerful statement, a different outlook on family & self-acceptance. And guess what? It never sounded preachy nor pretentious; not for a single moment.

Another praiseworthy characteristic is the Action sequences or to be precise, all the Choreography behind! An incredible show for the Martial Arts fans and yeah FYI Simu Liu (Shang-Chi); our primary protagonist did most of his stunts, all by himself; that is amazing Isn't it?

Pretty much the same impression applies to all the other members of the ensemble; however, I do have some serious reservations about their respective character depictions.

To start with, Shang-Chi's estranged father (Played by a veteran, Tony Leung Chiu-wai); The writing on his character felt a bit detached and incoherent! Don't know about you, but for the most part, I was rather uncertain about what should I exactly feel about this guy! Should I be sympathetic or furious about the choices he had made? Gotta say this dilemma got the better of me.

Furthermore, the Mother of Shang-Chi (Played by Fala Chen) from Ta-Lo; I do feel her screentime in here should have been elongated a little bit more! Just so the viewers could grasp her part of the storyline too! Other than that, she, herself was pretty great in there. No complaints whatsoever. And Oh yeah, Nora Lum or Awkwafina (The Name, majority of you might know her by). She was terrific in her role as well; the much-needed comic relief in such a sob story!

In a nutshell, I must admit, this was a rather unprecedented gamble from Marvel and It did pay off quite well in the end. To be honest, I couldn't be more pleased about that! As I see it, these Superhero films tend to get repetitious over the years so it's always like a breath of fresh air whenever there is a drastic transition coming straight from the creators, and when it gets backed up by the Big Studios themselves; well that's your cherry on top.","Let's keep aside all these serious conversations about Asian Representation, Diversity and all other societal stuff for a moment and let us all just appreciate Marvel for creating one of the most (if not the Most) emotionally charged superhero movies in recent times.

597,597,What a pleasant surprise this was!,"Visually a perfect film for me watching a film in theatre after 20 months. Going in I expected marvel to half-ass the genre but still make it entertaining like a number of their other films. But I was taken aback wonderfully right from the beginning with the opening narration completely in Chinese. What I saw then was a proper modern wuxia fantasy which with some changes could've fooled me for a Chinese production (maybe I'm being a bit hyperbolic).

As fitting to a wuxia film, the lust for power, the love that conquers evil and the despair of lost love are all seen in this film. And who best to bring all those than the legendary Tony Leung who was the face of Hong Kong cinema through In The Mood For Love and acted in some of the best Wuxia films. He was definitely the best thing about the film. I was half expecting Marvel to mess it up like they use great actors for villains all the time. But he was the first main character to appear and even till the end his presence was felt.

This also has some of the best hand to hand action sequences in the MCU easily. The martial arts action, even when the superpowers are included also makes the action just beautiful which is something I feel the first time in an MCU film.

Awkwafina was quirky but what I liked there was that they kept it platonic and didn't jump into anything at any point. Maybe they'd do that in the future but at least they didn't break the flow in the relationship. Meng'er Zhang and Fala Chen also made their presence felt, as badass fighters. And Michelle Yeoh as expected of her came in and owned the screen when she was present.

I'm really surprised at how much I liked the film. The final fight sequences that rose to the most epic Chinese fantasy fight you can think of is the only thing I was expecting them to not mess up. Maybe it is because of my low expectations on how Marvel deals with the genre and the villain that made me love this so much.","Visually a perfect film for me watching a film in theatre after 20 months.

598,598,A Very Fresh MCU Entry,"When Iron Man hit theatres back in 2008, there were rumblings about a cinematic universe starting, but obviously, nobody expected that we would make it to a film like Avengers: Endgame at the time. Along the way, unknown properties like Guardians of the Galaxy and Ant-Man came out of nowhere as well but were welcomed with open arms. I was really hoping that Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings would follow in those footsteps, and it more than does. With rich world-building, a great cast, and the use of mythology, this is one of my favourite Marvel Cinematic Universe entries to date. Over time I may even come to appreciate it even more. After a first viewing, here's why Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings deserves to be seen on the big screen (if you can).

After being trained as an assassin by his father, Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) is given ten years of freedom from this life. In the present, the film picks up with Shang-Chi (Shaun) as he is living a normal life in San Francisco with his friend Katy (Awkwafina). When the history/mythology of the so-called Ten Rings is brought back into the forefront, his mission is to go and find his father. With the help of his friend and sister, they return home to face the music and it may just end up being father vs son to save this world. From start to finish, this film delves into the fun, the mythological, the family drama, and some incredible martial arts in order to tell this very solid story.

Aside from the fact that newcomer Simu Liu is undeniably charming and very likeable in this role, it's the unique style of the movie that made it stand out from the rest of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Yes, it still has the same look and feel, especially when it comes to aesthetics and comedic relief, but the rest of the film had its own distinct heartbeat. Bringing martial arts into this franchise just felt like a breath of fresh air to me. Not only does it feel simultaneous that they're trying to have fun and pay homage to classic films of this nature, but the fact that martial arts, mixed with actual god-like powers just felt so earned by the climax of the film. Without giving anything away, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is far more magical and mystical than I was expecting, but I kind of loved the finale when looking back on it.

There's really not much about this film that I feel compelled to complain about, but I will say that with as much drama that this film has and with how much it does dive into mythology, sometimes the comedy felt out of place. Awkwafina as Katy was great and I think her chemistry with Simu Liu was great as well, but I think certain cuts to her one-liners felt a little unnecessary for the specific situation. There are a few scenes where moments deserve our full attention, but the film felt the need to cut away to something funnier. Aside from the humour taking me out a few times, this film is just a blast.

Overall, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Tens Rings is easily at the top of the origin films that this franchise has given us and probably one of my favourite entries as a whole. Director Destin Daniel Cretton (Short Term 12, Just Mercy) has done a great job here and the cinematography by Bill Pope (The Matrix, Baby Driver) was also a real standout. I thought the scope of the movie felt very grand and that's absolutely in part to how it was filmed. I almost thought the finale of the movie was going to be a huge negative, but again, after thinking about the movie again, there is a nice progression in the story that makes the climax feel earned, even if a tad overblown. If you're a fan of this franchise, this one is a must-see, but even if you're not, this one can stand on its own as well, having only a few acknowledgements to previous films.

Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is now playing exclusively in theatres and if you're able to go in your area, I highly recommend it.","When Iron Man hit theatres back in 2008, there were rumblings about a cinematic universe starting, but obviously, nobody expected that we would make it to a film like Avengers: Endgame at the time.

599,599,Good,"One of the best origin MCU films. Good story, great and complex family relationships, with it's own identity, a very good balance between action and comedy and really good fight scenes. Between Simu Liu, Awkwafina and Tony Leung it's difficult to decide which was the best, but the acting was really strong all around (also a mention to Ben Kingsley, always funny!). The best thing I can say about it is that for most of it's duration it didn't even feel like an MCU film.

The negatives? Again, too much CGI. It's a huge problem with Marvel and Disney as they use the green screen in almost every scene. I like CGI but seriously, some scenes would look much better with practical effects, others would look way better if they just were shot at location.","One of the best origin MCU films.

601,601,Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings just became one of my absolute favorites of the entire MCU!,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free thoughts, please follow my blog to read my full review :)

""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings just became one of my absolute favorites of the entire MCU! Destin Daniel Cretton delivers an entertainment-heavy movie with arguably the best action ever seen in the cinematic universe. Through the outstanding mix of long takes, impressive fighting choreography, and jaw-dropping stunt work, Simu Liu shines with his martial arts skills, but also in tackling the identity issues of the protagonist.

""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings just became one of my absolute favorites of the entire MCU! Destin Daniel Cretton delivers an entertainment-heavy movie with arguably the best action ever seen in the cinematic universe. Through the outstanding mix of long takes, impressive fighting choreography, and jaw-dropping stunt work, Simu Liu shines with his martial arts skills, but also in tackling the identity issues of the protagonist.

Always hate it when they make a villain not really a villain as to not offend anyone. Shang Chi's father is supposed to be a pure villain, the mother storyline took away a lot from the real storyline.

Awkwafina's character becoming a boss archer after one day of training was equally ridiculous.

Hopefully if a sequel is made it will be darker, though I'll admit the Mandarin was a funny touch.","Hollywood trying to be too woke about being Chinese.

605,605,A Great Origin Film,"The next instalment of the MCU, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings has come out and I managed to see it the other day and I have finally found time to review it and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees a young martial artist forced to face his past when his criminal father comes hunting for him.

Main Character Relative unknown Simu Liu plays Shang-Chi and he is really good in this role. He really delivers a strong performance and you will come out of the film really liking him and caring about the character of Shang-Chi. The focus on his family dynamic is really well done and Liu does a great job in selling that and showing the pain that he has been through in his life and bringing this great hero to life. He is also fantastic in the action scenes and that is a huge part of this film and you have to believe in the heroes capabilities and I really did.

Supporting Characters Awkwafina plays his best friend Katy and I feel like this character is really going to split opinion, some will hate her, some will love her. I pretty much hit both ends of the spectrum, I thought she was really annoying in the first act of the film and it hurt my enjoyment, but as she had her role slightly lessened she became much more likeable and her character arc became very clear. Tony Leung plays his first role in an American film playing Wenwu and this is one of the best antagonists in the current MCU. I loved this character and performance, he isn't just some generic bad guy and at times I really understood his motivations and saw the emotion from his performance and it was really strong. Meng'er Zhang plays Xialing and I liked her character here and I thought it really complemented Shang-Chi really well. There is clearly issues there and the film plays it up well, and makes her more then just this female sidekick and she is given a personality.

Story The story is at its strongest when it focuses on the family issues between the characters, in particular Shang-Chi and Wenwu. That father and son dynamic is great and both actors deliver really well in their roles and it makes there clashes feel even more important as you genuinely care about both of them in the film. The issue is that the film kind of strays away from that and tries to focus on too much. It has plenty of exposition scenes and fits so much in that it distracts from the main thing that makes this film great. The final act puts the focus in the wrong place, its hard to explain without spoilers but I think you will know what I mean if you watch the film.

Script The script is okay, the drama is really well done and made me care about these characters and the emotional predicaments that they are put in during this adventure and I actually think this film is held back a little bit by the fact that it is in the MCU. What I mean by that is that it has the humour you come to expect from the universe is here but it is done poorly and I never really laughed at all and that was a disappointment.

Style The film looks fantastic, the CGI is all beautiful and I think it does an excellent job of building this world of Martial arts that is very different to other elements of the MCU. The fight scenes live up to the hype and are the best that have been seen in The Marvel Cinematic Universe, the flow so well and are so hard hitting that it is easily the best element of the film.

Overall Overall, Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings is a great film and another solid addition to The Marvel Cinematic Universe. It isn't top tier Marvel but does a great job of introducing a new hero in Shang-Chi.

606,606,A wonderful addition to the MCU!,"Shang-Chi is one of those Marvel films that feels like the full package. It has lots of brilliant trademark MCU humour and tongue in cheek quips. It has exceptional action which I'll get into a bit more. It also has solid connections to the rest of the MCU, balanced well between being its own stand alone film but laying hints of how this is going to fit into the wider story of Phase 4.

I'll start with the action as this is what Shang-Chi is famed for. Quite simply it's awesome. It has the best hand to hand combat the MCU has seen, and sequences that are steeped in Chinese culture, with the rhythmic style of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon woven into the fabric of this film.

The cast was brilliant. Simu Liu was a fantastic lead, and I'd be happy to see him grow into a big player in the MCU. Awkwafina as expected was fantastic, adding so much effortless humour to the film.

What I really love about Shang-Chi is that it has a very well explored and interesting antagonist. This can't always be said for Marvel films as there have been a few phoned in villains, but Shang-Chi doesn't come close to falling into this trap. Tony Leung really sold his role and gave it a lot of power and emotion.

In terms of plot they did a fantastic job of introducing us to this pretty obscure character. There is a lot of exposition and plenty of flashbacks, perhaps too many but I appreciate they had a lot of background content to feed us so I can't grumble too much. I loved how the plot was so mystical and magical, very much feeling like an epic adventure.

Yet again Marvel Studios knocking it out of the park!","Shang-Chi is one of those Marvel films that feels like the full package.

607,607,nothing out of this world but a lot better then i expected,,
608,608,Showcases the possibilities of Phase 4,"This was the right direction for Marvel to head post-Endgame. Finding new stories to tell within cultures rarely explored is the way for the MCU to continue to entertain.

The fights in the first third of this movie were absolutely brutal and quite innovative. I wish they hadn't front-loaded all of this stunning choreography since the fights later on paled in comparison. This film also contains arguably the most beautiful and artful scene in the MCU with the Crouching Tiger-inspired hidden garden duel. There was a sense of more indie-based filmmaking and I really enjoyed that fresh take on the genre. I would be remiss not to mention Tony Leung, who perfectly brings to life one of the finest villains in the MCU. His character has a lot of depth and is one you can truly empathize with.

While there are still the tropes expected in a Marvel origin film, it succeeds pretty well for the most part. I wish the big CGI battle at the end had just been a personal fight between father and son, but alas. The humor, especially Awkwafina, was pretty hit or miss as well. The Trevor Slattery stuff was great though.

Shang-Chi is definitely one of the best origin films in the MCU and really stands out as a unique entry in the long-running series.","This was the right direction for Marvel to head post-Endgame.

609,609,Really good blend of martial arts and MCU formula,"The bus fight scene is one of the best action scenes of the entire MCU. Just for that scene alone, this movie deserves to be watched on the biggest screen possible. Shang Chi benefited from being a very unknown character and the movie gives him the opportunity to shine bright with his development. The story is really fast paced and even if the final act succumbs to the typical Marvel esque, it leaves you with a pretty solid good feeling while leaving the cinema. A really great MCU movie, a superb martial arts spectacle and a great step up for the Phase 4. Do not miss the two post credits scenes. The middle scene is exciting and the very last one is pretty intriguing. Bring it on, Marvel!","The bus fight scene is one of the best action scenes of the entire MCU.

610,610,The birth of a new legend,"The birth of a new Marvel Hero. And a very successful one. One of the better Marvel adaptations of the recent years and the perfect introduction of this new hero.

Its packed with amazing action, a great legacy and a wisely picked cast who get the chance to portray fun characters.

To start with Simu Liu who shoots himself to stardom with this film. His portrayal was fun as he perfectly mixes the hero attitude with a nice tongue-in-cheek humor and perfectly develops himself without taking all of it too seriously. Same goes to his co-star Awkwafina who was perfectly cast. Having Tony Leung as the to center-part was an excellent creative decision. Then the film has some fan favorites appearing as Ben Kingsley's Trevor or Benedict Wong who round it up to a wonderful Marvel adventure, just as you would expect.

The action scenes are tremendous, as the film is filled with great Martial Arts sequences, (of course Michelle Yeoh is not to be missed here). The bus scene at the beginning is a true stand out action scene in the entire Marvel universe.

Really a good one for the next phase of Marvel, and I like how it links to the whole universe just perfectly. Another Marvel winner.","The birth of a new Marvel Hero. And a very successful one. One of the better Marvel adaptations of the recent years and the perfect introduction of this new hero.

611,611,Elevates itself above the typical superhero origin story by incorporating many fantastic elements from Asian culture,"""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" is the second film in Phase Four of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Starring Simu Liu, Tony Leung, and Awkwafina, it elevates itself above the typical superhero origin story by incorporating many fantastic elements from Asian culture.

In San Francisco, Shaun (Simu Liu) works as a parking valet along with his close friend Katy (Awkwafina). Unbeknownst to Katy, Shaun is hiding important secrets from her - he is in fact a skilled martial artist whose real name is Shang-Chi and he has run away from his father Xu Wenwu (Tony Leung), the leader of the powerful Ten Rings organisation. After some Ten Rings members attack the pair of them on a bus, Shang-Chi discovers that they have stolen a valuable pendant given to him by his mother Li (Fala Chen) before he left for the United States. Shang-Chi grows concerned that the Ten Rings' next target will be the pendant belonging to his younger sister Xialing (Meng'er Zhang), and so along with Katy he sets off to look for her before the gang can locate her first.

Now that the Infinity Saga has concluded, the time has come for some new heroes to enter the MCU. Of course, there are so many to choose from, considering the large roster of characters that have come into existence over the last several decades. Although Shang-Chi wasn't the first one to come to my mind when predicting who would lead the charge of fresh faces into Phase Four, his debut big screen outing ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" successfully cements him as a memorable hero just as worthy as any other past Avenger.

What I believe separates this film from the typical hero origin story is all of the interesting aspects of Asian culture it integrates into the story. I'm all for inclusivity in movies, so long as it isn't shoehorned in there for the sake of appeasing a political agenda, and here it succeeds greatly thanks to the wide array of Asian crew members who worked hard to ensure that virtually all customs are represented. The film never precisely establishes the place Shang-Chi's family is from (though it is hinted to be somewhere in mainland China), as they are seen observing various cultural traditions that don't quite narrow things down to one particular Asian country. For example, there are martial artists resembling Shaolin monks, who are supposed to be from China, seen using techniques from Japanese and Korean folklore. This has likely been done on purpose to ensure that all Asian audiences feel included, but never so much that it comes across as disrespectful. After previously bungling Asian-related matters with the terrible 2020 remake of ""Mulan"", ""Shang-Chi"" feels like an appropriate apology from Disney to all of their viewers.

At this stage, it feels pointless to complain about Marvel films following the exact same template when introducing new heroes so I won't hold that against this one too much. With that said, thanks to some brilliantly choreographed martial arts fight scenes and gorgeous visuals, director Destin Daniel Cretton (""Just Mercy"") has provided us with one of the most unique looking MCU films to date. One scene near the beginning features Xu Wenwu walking through a bright, beautiful oriental garden complete with bamboo reeds in the foreground. A short time later, he is locked in hand-to-hand combat with his future love interest Li. This reminded me of ""wuxia"" films, a popular subgenre of Chinese martial arts movies, like ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"". In fact, this scene was such a good tribute to that genre that I almost forgot this was a Marvel movie and was instead watching one of those classic Kung Fu films my dad used to show me when I was young. You know you've created something special when your film can appeal this effectively to fans of both Marvel and Kung Fu movies.

Considering the last thing I saw him in was the sitcom ""Kim's Convenience"", Simu Liu definitely took me by surprise as to how well cast he was as the film's main star. I was expecting him to be a wisecracking Americanised version of the Asian hero but he actually plays most of the film straight, only responding humorously when absolutely necessary. His dramatic side truly shines when he is interacting with his onscreen father Tony Leung. In fact, Leung's character Xu has one of the most tragic backstories of any character in the whole MCU, which I won't spoil here. Another surprise was Awkwafina as Shang-Chi's best friend Katy. Rather than being another typical love interest, Katy is instead a loyal platonic friend of his who is willing to help him out no matter how limited her knowledge on the field of battle may be. It also helps that she is responsible for most of the film's comic relief.

With a new superhero now officially introduced, it's safe to assume that ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" has shown an optimistic future for the MCU. Its broad appeal to Eastern and Western audiences alike as well as the usual action-packed fun we've come to expect over the years makes it one of the best origin films to come out of the MCU to date. The Marvel hype train shows no signs of slowing down and if things keep going the way they are, it won't be stopping anytime soon.

614,614,"It's very pretty, but the story/plot is mediocre and filled with holes","As far as visuals go, this movie is amazing... like just about as impressive as Dune, it's filled to the brim with eye-candy.

The plot/story however is mediocre and filled with plot holes... the characters' actions are often unrealistic and they will often just 'stare in awe' at their friends being killed, instead of doing the realistic thing, and immediately defending their friends... it's something that happens like 5 times and honestly spoils the movie for me.... if characters in a movie don't act or react realistically and stare at something like a braindead zombie (like their friends getting killed right in front of them, whilst they are holding a gun in their freeking hands), then it's just really terrible script/plot writing.

Overall, the movie isn't as bad as Ant-Man 2 but it's not far behind. Also, Awkwafina's acting style was already old by the 2nd movie she did... ALL of her characters in movies are the same person, and like I said, it got boring after the 2nd movie. I roll my eyes at everything Awkwafina's character does in the movie.

It's a 5/10 movie, not really worth a watch unless you're a real die-hard Marvel fan.","As far as visuals go, this movie is amazing... like just about as impressive as Dune, it's filled to the brim with eye-candy.

615,615,There's Dragon Fights!,"What more do you want?

I honestly didn't want to like this film. As you may have read in previous reviews of the Marvel films, they are all dumb. And this one ends as they all do, with just massive CGI chaos. But did I mention they were dragons fighting?

Anyway, the film is fun. Fun and lively in the sense of watching a water painting come to life. The fight sequences are laborious...sometimes. Since being rocked with energy source that could topple buildings doesn't even crack a rib seems silly.

But Shang-Chi makes it work. Here played by the moon-faced wide-eyed and fun loving Simu Liu. And he does a wonderful job NOT wanting to be anything but a typical slacker. While he carries the burden of a darker past..haunted, even...he does his best to make the best of his situation with his San Fran pal Katy. Now usually Awkwafina irritates me to no end. Here, she is much more subdued and is truly a ""bro"" any guy would want in a sisterly form/love interest. The balance of her hip banter to seriousness is flawless. And quite the joy when not on screen.

Big kudos to Tony Leung. Who has spent generations emoting with the most efficient use of words. He doesn't require much and carries a lot. He plays a former evil doer whose only motivation is love.

His fatherly love for his children is only surpassed by regaining a love he's lost. And truly embodies that person who cannot let it go. But that credit goes to Li, played by Fala Chen. A gentle soul in what can be described as Shangri-La. I could watch her do kata for hours. Her gracefulness would make any man want to open the gates of Hell for.

Much praise goes to director Destin Cretton for balancing spirituality with family ties. This is a very difficult line to tow while trying not to be overbearing. He was smart enough to know that the family dynamics of an Asian household have small passive-aggressive moments that pick at the main characters. But doesn't ever go past the ""you must have honor"" trope that infects a movie like ""Mulan""","What more do you want?

But somehow somewhere it felt like the film was actually made for kids maybe because of the story being wholly dependent on the magical dragon.

617,617,An Asian Marvel Origin story with all the spectacle you've come to expect.,"Another great and entertaining experience which is very similar to what has gone before in format, but the formula works very well and I enjoyed the film a lot. The Asian style and presentation is beautiful, showing off plenty of folklore and style in both modern and traditional settings. The presentation is very stylish, the special effects were superb and the martial arts fight scenes were fast and exciting The plot is good, focusing on the human and family side of the characters rather than the magical, and sets up a good intrigue for the continuation of the MCU. The acting is good and although the comic relief and cute character did change things up, they also spoiled it a bit and made the slow middle section drag on even more. The ending was pretty grand and epic, but I felt it could have been better.","Another great and entertaining experience which is very similar to what has gone before in format, but the formula works very well and I enjoyed the film a lot.

619,619,Unique. But a very fun film,"I have to say I was looking forward to this one. First film in a while that had no connection to avengers etc so I was intrigued to see how they would do this. And on the whole it was very enjoyable and fun to watch!

First instincts when watching were a little mixed. It was an odd start to say the least and didn't have any idea how this was going to go. And my first instincts on Katy were also mixed. I felt like they were trying to force the humour out on her and I found her character really annoying. HOWEVER..

Once it gets going the film gets better and better. Katy becomes a great character and all the characters development and arcs on a whole were truly phenomenal! For me the best part of the film was the characters and seeing them all develop throughout.

So is the plot good? To be blunt, yes! It's truly unique and uniquely done in so many ways, I don't want to give out anything that would spoil anything, but it's really not what you expect. That's all I say!



I'll shut up now! I'll just say it's well worth watching. It's a great ""superhero"" to have and a great one to watch. And overall it's a fun, visually pleasing and brilliant watch. I recommend.","I have to say I was looking forward to this one. First film in a while that had no connection to avengers etc so I was intrigued to see how they would do this.

622,622,Really enjoyable film 7/10,"Shang - Chi is the new hero of the MCU and everyone is going to love him. Although I have a really deep criticism over fase 4 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I've decided to go watch the movie in theaters (after two years of being away from theaters due to covid). Overall I really enjoyed it. There were still a few moments that I regretted and that were dull. Not to mention ""little mistakes"" that Marvel keep doing with their movies. In general it was a fun experience. The plot didn't have much to offer to be honest: another origin story of a superhero that tries to run away from his fate and responsibilities. Until he is forced to face his past.

This has been the kind of way for Marvel to introduce their new characters in the MCU, I wished they would have been more creative but they do deliver creativity for once. Watching people speak their native language for once was a huge step up for Marvel. The movie is also influenced by many other asian classic films such as ""Hero"", ""Hidden Dragon"", ""Seven Samurai"" and ""In the mood for love"".

Of course it wouldn't be a Marvel movie without some end credits scenes (how original). The end credit scene does confirm the return of Shang Chi at some point, but what the end credits scene does confirm moreover is how the future Marvel films will all get connected. As I said before, I'm less optimistic with this whole fase 4 of Marvel but it wouldn't hurt or kill to watch a few of them. To me, I just wanted to return to the theaters.

Speaking of actors: Simu Liu is a fantastic actor and will definitely become a fan favorite, both him and his character. Awkwafina steals the show every single time she's on screen. Tony Leung is wonderful and acts so well. The whole cast is perfect. If you are in favor of theaters and Marvel movies than go watch Shang Chi.

P. S: the end credit song - Fire in the Sky by Anderson Paak. Is the best part of the movie.","Shang - Chi is the new hero of the MCU and everyone is going to love him.

Disney work through the numbers on this film, there are no surprises and it does what it does on the tin.

The acting is good, special effects are solids and the story is not bad.

There's continuity linking to the other marvel universe which is nice for the fans.

I would actually pitch this at 7.5/10, not quite an 8 but higher than a 7

626,626,Awesome.,"Best fight scenes since the civil war airport scene. They mess up simply by trying to make the character 10 years younger then the actor is.

Great addition to MCU , especially after the quality level the shows have been.","Best fight scenes since the civil war airport scene.

628,628,Refreshing and Captivating!,"""I gave you ten years to live your life. And where did that get you? You walked in my shadow.""

Marvel Studios' Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings follows Shang-Chi, a seemingly ordinary young man from San Francisco who parks cars for a living alongside his friend, as must confront the past he thought he left behind when he is drawn into the web of the mysterious Ten Rings organization. Marvel took a big chance on this project. Of course we've had lesser known heroes end up getting their own movie franchise within the MCU, but Shang-Chi is not one many know about. Little was known going in other than we'd get some action scenes and explore new territory within the MCU. What they managed to do with Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings is unlike any Marvel movie yet. Destin Daniel Cretton takes a new approach that works wonders. His previous works of Short Term 12 and Just Mercy are heartfelt dramas so something big like this is new territory, but he incorporates the same style and messages into this. The dysfunctional family dynamic serving as the character arc and forming the conflict is so much deeper than some random business guy who wants to rule the world. With this story, it's easy to connect with it and understand character motives. I will say there's a lot to pack in here and the story can get muddy at points, but it pulls itself together that we retain most of everything.

Simu Liu is fantastic in the title role. Previous to watching, I hadn't seen him in anything. But he has all the skills as an emerging actor to be a household name. Shang-Chi is an interesting character to follow. As he discovers and recalls moments from his upbringing, we can slowly piece him together. There's much more to be made from him, but with future installments we'll be able to get much more. And Tony Chiu-Wai Leung is perfectly cast as Xu Wenwu. He's a villain I can understand, like, and dislike all at the same time. He's flawed, but there's depth to him. And he almost steals the show by the end with another showcase of mad acting skills. But the character I've been thinking of a lot, and mainly because she was so hilarious, is Awkwafina as Katy. Awkwafina is one of my favorite actresses working right now, especially after her role in The Farewell, and she smashes this. Katy is the typical comedic sidekick but so much fun. One of the funniest jokes comes from her and I was laughing hysterically. Maybe more character will come from her later, but what we got was enough for me. I can't wait to see her again! I should also mention Meng'er Zhang as Xialing. This is her first role and she's also great. What they'll do with her next should be interesting.

From a technical standpoint, this is impressive for a Marvel movie. There are some stunning visuals. The cinematography isn't that gray color scheme used in most, though it does fall into that later on, and bursting with color. And as you probably know, the visual effects are as good as they come. It's not muddled with CGI and a scene that was completely green screen, which is nice to see. Also, Marvel has been doing great with the themes and score lately because this is another great one, along with the soundtrack. Paired with this are the best fight scenes out of the whole MCU. The stunt choreography is top notch and is beautiful and intense to look at. The bus scene early on is the best yet and will be hard to top! Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings just really did it for me and most everybody can agree. It's refreshing and captivating in every way. Marvel has been taking some big leaps with this new phase and it gets me more and more excited for each new installment!","""I gave you ten years to live your life. And where did that get you?

632,632,Shang-Chi and the legend of The Ten Rings - enjoyably unMarvellous film. 80%,"""Shang-Chi and the legend of The Ten Rings"" is a superhero origin story which seems more like a Chinese martial arts film than the next entrant in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Many years ago I saw ""Crouching tiger, hidden dragon"" and found the fight scenes in that literally unbelievable a lot of the time. ""Shang-Chi"" often seems subtle in its fight scenes by comparison but then does have action sequences which are more like MCU superhero films. As an origin story, it assumes no familiarity with the MCU and in fact plays mostly as a non-MCU film, which is what I liked about it.

Simu Liu plays Shang-Chi/Shaun, the son of a mobster, Xu Wenwu (played by Tony Leung) who could quite easily have been the subject of a film or franchise himself, due to his legendary characteristics. Shang-Chi's mother Ying Li (played by Fala Chen) is also a legendary kind of character. This contrast of 'Eastern' legendary figures and 'Western' MCU legendary figures worked to the former's advantage, as the latter often come across as plastic toy figurines being used in a sandpit by small boys to play with.

The plot concerns how Shang-Chi/Shaun sought to move from under the shadow of his father to become his own man but just when he thought he was out, he is pulled back into Wenwu's orbit. The film mixes the seriousness, perhaps, of Chinese martial arts films with the jokey style of American Hollywood films. As should be expected from a MCU film, eventually the fate of the world will come into play and someone will have to play the hero to save it.

The martial arts in this film juxtaposes frenetic fight sequences with elegant and fluid fight scenes which have their own particular charm. Other times the action sequences seem lifted from a Disney live action family film and that was enjoyable too, if you just suspended disbelief.

Speaking of comedy, I found the earliest instance of this to be aiming very low for laughs, which isn't uncommon in MCU films but I warmed to later instances of it. For instance, I was amused by the character of a thespian who sounded like he was from Liverpool, when he reminisced about what he took from a film that he saw as a teenager and how that inspired him to get into acting. That actor playing the thespian did seem familiar, perhaps for his voice but I did recognise his name in the closing credits and remembered the role that he is perhaps best known for.

An interesting aspect to this film is its subject matter, i.e. An Asian superhero and a mostly Asian cast. Is this another attempt by Hollywood to crack the now important Chinese market? If it is, then the cooling relations between the US and China is an unwelcome fly in the ointment for Hollywood studios trying to make a lot of money from Chinese cinemagoers.

Another question that came into my mind was whether ""The Ten Rings"" is based on Chinese legend or is a Marvel appropriation of Chinese culture, tailored for 'Western' audiences that don't care about cultural authenticity. If it isn't the former, then I think that there could be a niche for films which mine authentic 'Eastern' legends and myths. That could be something which might interest me (Sinophiles would no doubt reel out a long list of films which have done just that!).

As you might have guessed, I wasn't the first in line to see this film. In fact, I wasn't even sure that I wanted to see it, as I haven't watched every line of superhero films in the MCU (maybe I should watch ""The Black Panther""?). As it stands, I think it was worth the punt in seeing it. I'd go so far as to say that seeing a sequel to this would be more appealing if it wasn't tied to The Avengers franchise! Furthermore, I would have liked this film not to remind that it was part of the MCU, which it managed to do, at least until the closing credits, which I didn't welcome when it made its first appearance. With that being said, this is the kind of film that you could watch again, after a suitable break. Although I didn't watch this film in 3D, it might be worth it to do so (as sometimes the extra cost of the ticket gives added value to the experience and...sometimes it doesn't).

Notes to self:

* The narrative did have some logical gaps in it, for example why Shang-Chi was attacked on the bus. What was that all about?

* The film was dedicated to the memory of Brad Allan, I think. Not sure who that was...searching now, a few websites list him as the supervising stunt coordinator.

* Reading the closing credits, I was reminded that this film was shot in Australia, which isn't obvious watching it, so, good job studio (I think I saw or heard something on ABC in Australia about how Asian Australians got to be in this film, perhaps a kung fu exponent or exponents)!

* My score for this film was tracking from 75% (7 out of 10 stars) to 75+% (8 out 10 stars) to just a flat 80% final score.","""Shang-Chi and the legend of The Ten Rings"" is a superhero origin story which seems more like a Chinese martial arts film than the next entrant in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Many years ago I saw ""Crouching tiger, hidden dragon"" and found the fight scenes in that literally unbelievable a lot of the time. ""Shang-Chi"" often seems subtle in its fight scenes by comparison but then does have action sequences which are more like MCU superhero films. As an origin story, it assumes no familiarity with the MCU and in fact plays mostly as a non-MCU film, which is what I liked about it.

Simu Liu plays Shang-Chi/Shaun, the son of a mobster, Xu Wenwu (played by Tony Leung) who could quite easily have been the subject of a film or franchise himself, due to his legendary characteristics. Shang-Chi's mother Ying Li (played by Fala Chen) is also a legendary kind of character. This contrast of 'Eastern' legendary figures and 'Western' MCU legendary figures worked to the former's advantage, as the latter often come across as plastic toy figurines being used in a sandpit by small boys to play with.

The plot concerns how Shang-Chi/Shaun sought to move from under the shadow of his father to become his own man but just when he thought he was out, he is pulled back into Wenwu's orbit. The film mixes the seriousness, perhaps, of Chinese martial arts films with the jokey style of American Hollywood films. As should be expected from a MCU film, eventually the fate of the world will come into play and someone will have to play the hero to save it.

The martial arts in this film juxtaposes frenetic fight sequences with elegant and fluid fight scenes which have their own particular charm. Other times the action sequences seem lifted from a Disney live action family film and that was enjoyable too, if you just suspended disbelief.

Speaking of comedy, I found the earliest instance of this to be aiming very low for laughs, which isn't uncommon in MCU films but I warmed to later instances of it. For instance, I was amused by the character of a thespian who sounded like he was from Liverpool, when he reminisced about what he took from a film that he saw as a teenager and how that inspired him to get into acting. That actor playing the thespian did seem familiar, perhaps for his voice but I did recognise his name in the closing credits and remembered the role that he is perhaps best known for.

An interesting aspect to this film is its subject matter, i.e. An Asian superhero and a mostly Asian cast. Is this another attempt by Hollywood to crack the now important Chinese market? If it is, then the cooling relations between the US and China is an unwelcome fly in the ointment for Hollywood studios trying to make a lot of money from Chinese cinemagoers.

Another question that came into my mind was whether ""The Ten Rings"" is based on Chinese legend or is a Marvel appropriation of Chinese culture, tailored for 'Western' audiences that don't care about cultural authenticity. If it isn't the former, then I think that there could be a niche for films which mine authentic 'Eastern' legends and myths. That could be something which might interest me (Sinophiles would no doubt reel out a long list of films which have done just that!).

633,633,Phase Four is in Full Swing!,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings far surpassed any expectations I had. It's easily the best Marvel movie post-Infinity Saga (I know, that's not exactly saying much), and is very promising for the quality of Marvel's next projects. We have probably the second best villain intimately tied to the origin of a new, entertaining, and capable hero full of potential, in a story that ties the universe together and teases upcoming events in tantalising and unexpected ways. The fight choreography was on point, the dialogue was seeped in cultural significance, the jokes all land, and the CGI is some of the best since Thanos himself. Shang-Chi is an all-out success for Marvel, it seems in multiple ways - both critically and financially. Really its only downfall is that at times this doesn't feel like that much of a movie about Shang-Chi himself purely because his origin is tied so closely to the story of the Ten Rings. Instead it's a Ten Rings movie featuring Shang-Chi, which is fine, but feels a bit weird for his introduction into the MCU. And yes, the Ten Rings are tied up with the Iron Man films perfectly, almost making the whole Aldrich Killian thing better in retrospect. I give Shang-Chi a high 8/10, with promise of moving up with rewatches.","Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings far surpassed any expectations I had.

634,634,Feast for the eyes...,"I can't decide whether I loved this movie because it's great or if it's just the best cinematography Bill Pope's done since The Wachowski's ""The Matrix"" trilogy?

Either way, ""Shang-Chi"" is easily the most visually distinctive & stunning film in the MCU thus far - vibrant, kinetic, gorgeously framed / composed, with its own individualistic sense of personality - & the symbiosis between the fight choreography & camera work supercedes that of any previous installment in the Marvel franchise - resulting in an incredible style that works effortlessly throughout... I can't stress this enough - some moments are honestly breathtaking (my jaw was on the floor) & it's an utter joy to see such expertly constructed & perfectly timed sequences - of pure, unapologetic cinema - unfold. Allows the audience the uncommon opportunity to just sit back & relax whilst watching, safe in the knowledge those responsible for bringing the screenplay to life are trustworthy, capable hands. Hence, the creator's dependability reassures viewers that they can simply focus on enjoying the experience instead, making it even more fun.

Although I shouldn't be surprised everything's captured so masterfully - considering the reliably quirky inventiveness of the visionary director of photography at the helm of the project - despite his legendary status, I still wasn't expecting a solo film (made by such an infamously corporate production company which normally shuns creative experimentation of any kind, churning out unadventurous, generic, copy + paste origin stories) to be so shockingly well realised on screen, it would consequently make ""Avengers: Endgame"" look embarrassingly trivial & unengaging by comparison... Yet somehow, under the watchful eye of director Destin Daniel Cretton, together, this duo manage to accomplish exactly that successfully, capturing scenes with a unique confidence I rarely (if ever) see in recent comic book adaptations.

For instance, usually, I can't stand the bland, dull, grey, lifeless aesthetics of Disney movies (renowned for their very ugly colour grading & over reliance on CGI) but the filmmaking here feels as uncharacteristically bold, audacious, awe inspiring, original, immersive & as epic as James Wan's ""Aquaman"" or James Cameron's ""Avatar"", utilising VFX effectively to enhance the scale of the tale being told, rather than detract from the overall plot. Of course, technically impressive world building & enormous scale / grandiosity are meaningless qualities & hollow attributes to possess if the narrative lacks depth or engaging characters but thankfully, this offers just enough heart to additionally feel emotionally investable, as well as spectacular.

640,640,Surprisingly good.,"I have to say that this was a surprisingly good movie. I say surprisingly because Marvel (or DC for that matter) have not exactly excelled in making even decent movies for quite some time. That the woke ""critics"" on Rotten Tomatoes gave it high ratings was a bit of a red flag as well but not only was the movie rather free from woke ramblings and preaching but it was a very fun and entertaining movie to watch.

The movie starts off in a somewhat bizarre way with Shang-Chi and his girlfriend swiping a car from a valet parking and going for a joy ride. It turns out that they are telling their story to a couple of friends and that is pretty much how this movie is told.

It begins more or less right away with some nice action and it continues that away with plenty of action sequences intermixed with story telling. The action and martial arts is really good in my opinion. They are in stark contrast to the mediocre rubbish we were treated to in Snake Eyes. The latter which was quite a disappointment.

This movie relies heavily on fantasy elements with tie ins to Doctor Strange, especially towards the end. Another movie that I liked a lot by the way. Thus there are of course plenty of special effects and CGI. Most of them good or very good. I really liked the beautiful world of Ta Lo. The combat scenes, especially when the rings are in action are both cool and beautiful.

There are quite a lot of comical relief in the movie as well and, for once, it is not to silly, outrageous or plain stupid. It contributes well to the enjoyment factor of the movie. The washed out actor is a bit on the limit but otherwise it works well with the rest of the movie. That guy on the bus starting to film and make commentaries was quite hilarious for instance.

The story? Well it is a Marvel special effects movie so one should not expect too much but the story is not bad. It mostly holds together and works well enough to tie all the action together. The acting is pretty much the same thing. One should not expect too much but it is good enough. It was nice to see Michelle Yeoh as Ying Nan though. She was one of the few cool characters in Discovery and she does know how to act.

Overall I very much enjoyed this movie. It is a simple super hero and fantasy adventure story with lots of action and special effects and with the single purpose of entertaining the audience that doesn't fall in the trap of trying to ""educate"" said audience.","I have to say that this was a surprisingly good movie.

641,641,Surprisingly entertaining for MCU's 4th phase,"Now that we're finally into the fourth phase of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, we're getting to see the deep cuts from everyone's favorite superhero community. Despite having an unnecessarily long title, 'Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings' is a fun ride that doesn't feel like a retread of Marvel films past.

The introduction to Shaun (Shang-Chi, portrayed by Simu Liu) is handled well, as the character is likable and feels like a good fit among the established members of S. H. I. E. L. D. Comic relief comes in the form of Awkwafina's Katy - sidekick to Shaun - and an atypical showing by Sir Ben Kingsley, while more serious performances are delivered by veteran actors Tony Chiu-Wai Leung and Michelle Yeoh.

As for the plot, it can almost be split in two, as the first and second halves of 'Shang-Chi' feel like completely different films. The first half is very unserious and comes off as a companion to the latest 'Spider-man' entries, whereas the second half is a more traditional Marvel action-drama. Even though there are plenty of typical superhero tropes thrown in here with even more of a Disney imprint than past MCU movies, it's still enjoyable for what it is.

The somewhat surprising strength of 'Shang-Chi' suggests there's no slowing down in the MCU film factory.","Now that we're finally into the fourth phase of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, we're getting to see the deep cuts from everyone's favorite superhero community.

642,642,Sort of disappointed..,"I got to admit I wasn't particularly blown away by anything in the movie.. I might even say ""I was bored"" by it.

Don't get me wrong.. it IS a spectacle! The action is great. The locations are nice, costume design, sound design, etc. But it is overall a soft release not worth seeing in theaters.. specially as a follow-up to what Endgame was.

The biggest problem for me, is how the underwritten lead has muddled personality (for reasons covered in the story) devoid of charm, personality or good dialogue.

The next issue is the humor, which didn't land for me.. Not once. The supporting lead Awkwafina isn't her normal ""loud"" self that's supposed to be funny every time she opens her mouth. Her role is very supportive and a little dramatic. And while I questioned myself why was she even there for, it doesn't ultimately matter. She is another forgettable character that is given more importance than the role deserves.

Finally, the third act is weak. There's a balancing problem with stakes. You can't feel tension or weight to any action. And there's a lot of superficial ""I can't do it"" until they can.

In the end, this feels like a very safe plot, written in a way to appeal to china (considering how the Mandarin is portrayed), that ends up appealing to no one specific. Certainly doesn't feel like a Marvel movie.. but it was bound to happen if we are to be introduced to different aspects of the narrative. But it also doesn't feel like a comic book. It's more generic than that.","I got to admit I wasn't particularly blown away by anything in the movie.. I might even say ""I was bored"" by it.

644,644,Bold & Brilliant,"A bold step for the MCU, incorporating an Eastern cinema approach into it's franchise. With it's foundations built on choreography and humour, Shang-Chi beautifully brings in elements of famed Kung-Fu films and Chinese culture.

Taking inspiration from many martial arts, the action scenes - whilst exaggerated and outlandish in comparison to the film's peers - are brilliant. The addition of Kingsley is truly excellent too, as he and Awkwafina provide the majority of laughs.

A standalone plot whilst maintaining links to the MCU, Shangi-Chi creates a new platform for Marvel to explore, although clearly sets up the next Phase along with other releases from the year. The standout element is the creation of the new world and it's creatures though, a huge Disney budget bringing to life fabled animals long deserving of a spotlight.","A bold step for the MCU, incorporating an Eastern cinema approach into it's franchise.

645,645,Shang Chi and the legend of the ten rings,,
646,646,The Master of Kung-fu,"Shang chi and the legend of the ten rings we follow the story of a guy named Shang(Simu Liu) who lives your basic life In San Francisco. Working as a Valet parking car, and partying late nights with his best friend Katy(Awkwafina). Until one day a band of assassins targets Shang and it's revealed that he's actually an assassin trained at birth by his father Wenwu(Tony Leung Chiu-Wai). The leader of the ten rings an ancient Chinese organization that's existence for thousands of years, conquering kingdoms and overthrowing governments. Now Shang-Chi must faces his father and overcome the demons of his past. Each of these Marvel films I find most enjoyable is the world building, set up of this universal series. All these characters from various backgrounds and classes and worlds. Shang-Chi I can say is one of those welcome new additions. Similar to Guardians of the galaxy when this was announced I hadn't the slightest idea who this guy was. Usually when people think Martial artists with marvel they usually think Iron fist or daredevil. So going into this I had a blank expectation of what to see. It does pay tribute to old-school martial arts films while mixing fast action charm of a comic book with a blend of Chinese mythology and philosophy. It does helps gives the movie an identity and the characters overall I found them good not great, but I found them entertaining and likable. Shang's more or less just an ordinary guy just trying to live his life. Have fun make a new start and make the best of it. He's honestly more or less happy with his basic life. Though at the same time running from his old life his father,mother and sister. It all leaves an impact on him as a person. He's pretty emotional not Peter Parker emotional, but he still has a personality outside of just having a stoic Shaolin fighter serious persona. They could have easily done a chosen one theme with him that been done to death. He likes to joke and have fun along with his friend Katy. Awkwafina I'm not a fan of her I didn't really care for her in crazy Rich Asians or Raya and the last dragon. Here I found her character more funny and likable. She doesn't really come off as that annoying friend that's more or less in the way. Her and Simu do play well off each other and display this friendship of two different people who still very similar. I got sort of Rush hour vibe off them, there's even a fight scene outside on a bamboo scaffolding. She's not just a pointless tagalong she does have moments where the jokes don't work , though she does add to the film specifically in the finale. The tone of the movie still finds time to flesh them out. More or less the two of them are just goofballs at the beginning, once more's revealed it does take time to have it's more deep serious moments. Wenwu I found to be a really good villain and While technically this still isn't really the Mandarin that comic readers we're probably expecting. His overall character is very compelling he more borders the line like killmonger. You understand his reasons though his actions are unjustifiable. He does still manages to gives off this somewhat opposing demeanor not from his fighting, but from the way he present his self. I buy this guy used to be a tyrant and a Conqueror. I still wish his rings worked the same way though, really he just throws them like chakra and whips them around. As for the sister she's given minimal in this not really alot of moments. Outside of her childhood flash backstory it's clear later down the road their gonna do something her. The visuals are stunning to this one water effect the just pops off the screen. The use of elements being shown through the right use of slow motion. The landscape of Tao lo which has this very traditional Chinese style with Nine-tail foxes, and Fu dog(lions) that make that the rhinos from black panther looks bad. I want to see more places like this in future installments. A lot of these cg effects are on par with doctor strange.","Shang chi and the legend of the ten rings we follow the story of a guy named Shang(Simu Liu) who lives your basic life In San Francisco.

Though at the same time running from his old life his father,mother and sister. It all leaves an impact on him as a person. He's pretty emotional not Peter Parker emotional, but he still has a personality outside of just having a stoic Shaolin fighter serious persona. They could have easily done a chosen one theme with him that been done to death. He likes to joke and have fun along with his friend Katy. Awkwafina I'm not a fan of her I didn't really care for her in crazy Rich Asians or Raya and the last dragon. Here I found her character more funny and likable. She doesn't really come off as that annoying friend that's more or less in the way. Her and Simu do play well off each other and display this friendship of two different people who still very similar. I got sort of Rush hour vibe off them, there's even a fight scene outside on a bamboo scaffolding. She's not just a pointless tagalong she does have moments where the jokes don't work , though she does add to the film specifically in the finale. The tone of the movie still finds time to flesh them out. More or less the two of them are just goofballs at the beginning, once more's revealed it does take time to have it's more deep serious moments. Wenwu I found to be a really good villain and While technically this still isn't really the Mandarin that comic readers we're probably expecting. His overall character is very compelling he more borders the line like killmonger. You understand his reasons though his actions are unjustifiable. He does still manages to gives off this somewhat opposing demeanor not from his fighting, but from the way he present his self. I buy this guy used to be a tyrant and a Conqueror. I still wish his rings worked the same way though, really he just throws them like chakra and whips them around. As for the sister she's given minimal in this not really alot of moments. Outside of her childhood flash backstory it's clear later down the road their gonna do something her. The visuals are stunning to this one water effect the just pops off the screen. The use of elements being shown through the right use of slow motion. The landscape of Tao lo which has this very traditional Chinese style with Nine-tail foxes, and Fu dog(lions) that make that the rhinos from black panther looks bad. I want to see more places like this in future installments. A lot of these cg effects are on par with doctor strange."
647,647,Simply entertaining,"When shang chi was announced in phase 4, i got excited because i am a fan of martial arts films. But after the pandemic, i slowly started losing interest in the film because i felt that mcu won't be as good after endgame and my fear turned true with the post endgame movies. None of the films or series satisfied me. I saw shang chi with low expectations and got fully satisfied.

What i loved about shang chi the most was its entertaining. Post endgame, mcu got burdened with expectations to connect their films into a universe, set up future films and do something different but in that process forgot to provide entertainment. On the other hand, shang chi is not burdened with any of these and tells a simple and independent story. There is no deliberate connecting to the mcu, nor they are in a hurry to set up any sequels, also its not anything different as its a typical Chinese martial arts mythological film. The action scenes in train and skyscraper were mindblowing and best hand to hand action scenes after winter soldier(which black widow failed to provide). The female stars were also badass. The climax cgi action was okay.

Only drawback is there is nothing new in the plot as its that typical mcu storyline where our hero has daddy issues.

On the whole, shang chi and the legend of ten rings is a very good standalone mcu film after thor ragnarok.","When shang chi was announced in phase 4, i got excited because i am a fan of martial arts films.

649,649,A diverse new addition,"Shang Chi and the Legend of the Ten rings is one of the marvel's first phase 4 movies. In hindsight it has a underlying tone and story similar to that of Black Panther. Both being representations of certain groups and and their cultures.

The story is solid. It wasn't perfect as it had some minor flaws. A bit cheesy with good writing and comedy but nothing exceptional. The fight scenes , the choreography and dragons were cool which were refreshing compared to the last couple of MCU movies that were released. The characters are nothing to interesting other than Shang Chi and his dad and their whole dynamic.

Overall an enjoyable film. An eyecandy with some flaws but nonetheless was watchable and likable.

650,650,"What a waste of time, the other way around geographically","Too unrealistic movie, with too much special effect that they do not bother to cover up. Humoristic moments do not seem that funny. Also, how a thin someone holdoff a big guy?

Ugh, it is that classic moves of Hollywood and phrases. Like the headphone did not hear you. Or foreigner moving oversea. Suddenly it looks like how they are picturing America especially in the cab. Like your pants joke, hell no phrase when looking at height. Or was looking everywhere for you. Burn it down. Classic moves like using multiple people as a stair.

Hate it also that sometimes they just speak English but mostly Chinese, wondering what they want.

How much did the Chinese pay Disney?

Using big actors and adding a new guy in to keep the quality of the acting, with a bad script it does not do well. Especially when there is no innovative action in the players. They were copy and paste from another movie they played before.

Classic scenarios making it so predictable, and fights that could not be won due to lack of experience are own suddenly.

Acting is below average, quality of screen is high but too much special effect, camera work is OK because it has gotten took over multiple of times by special effects so can not give any real points. Sound is below average because they're using too much overused kinds.

1 time only movie. Points are given to the cast because they still try to make something out of it but still not pulling tit off and meeting the script only.

651,651,Destin Daniel Cretton; you've done it again!,"Marvel's latest feature introduces cinephiles to Shaun AKA Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) a martial arts master and a character created by Steve Englehart and Jim Starlin, first appearing in a Marvel publication back in 1973. Beginning in the first of many gorgeously choreographed and shot sequences, we're introduced to Shang-Chi's father Xu Wenwu (Tony Chiu-Wai Leung) and mother Li (Fala Chen) also entailing the awesome power of the Ten Rings which Xu currently has in his possession. What follows is a heart-pounding and ridiculously entertaining adventure movie with true heart.

Filled with beautiful performances not least from everyone already mentioned and including Awkwafina as Shaun's best friends Katy and Meng'er Zhang as sister Xialing, there's plenty here to adore on screen not even getting to the truly awe-inspiring action set pieces with the best fight scenes I've seen in recent memory. Cretton (Short Term 12, Just Mercy) is very quickly becoming one of my favourite directors having produced three incredible pieces of cinema in the last 8 years. It's great to see that his passion for storytelling and independent spirit still shines through his latest here while also staying true to the Marvel fan base (I really did not expect a certain character to show up but made for some really comical moments).

The visual effects are of course stunning but what makes them stand out here are how they're incorporated with the beautiful landscapes to enhance the feeling of authentically experiencing Shaun's heritage and getting wrapped up in the culture that the filmmakers so wonderfully explore. This is how origin stories should be made! The creature design is also incredible and is an integral element to making the final sequences all the more breathtaking.

Please do yourselves a favour and see this on the biggest screens possible, please support your local cinema and stay safe my friends.","Marvel's latest feature introduces cinephiles to Shaun AKA Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) a martial arts master and a character created by Steve Englehart and Jim Starlin, first appearing in a Marvel publication back in 1973.

652,652,Not a good movie,"This movie was a fist in the face or rather a razor fist. I don't know if the movie is bad or I can't watch Marvel movies anymore but I didn't like anything about this movie, neither the story, nor the special effects, nor the acting. It all seemed too exaggerated and predictable, plus two hours is really too much for a movie of this type.

The only interesting parts were the first minutes where you see the meeting between the parents and the clash between the abomination and the monk whose name I don't remember.

I think instead the worst part was the final battle, even the too long and exaggerated one.","This movie was a fist in the face or rather a razor fist.

However, later in the film we constantly get some new elements, the story expands, there is not always an explanation, and the worst part of the film was my last fight because I think they went too far with special effects, for me personally it was not watchable.

655,655,Finally something good again from Marvel,"Marvel has not done much good lately. 2 horrible TV shows, and 1 bad TV show. Not a single good movie since Captain Marvel, and nothing seemingly good coming over the horizon.

To be honest I have started to give up. Marvel have produced magnificent movies and great entertainment for many years, but lately it is like that magic has come off and they seem much more run of the mill basic with that, by now, boring Marvel feel. Marvel has tried to introduce more political correctness, more feminism, and more nonsense diversity, and it has all failed.

This movie however is not a failure.

Why?

This movie is simple, it is to the point, it follows tropes, cliches, and it is a classic heroes journey - which is exactly why it works!

Marvel took a classical story we all heard, read and seen before but they switched a few things around, kept some of that Marvel feel, and made it play out mainly in China and almost only with Chinese actors. And it works!

Imagine that? Sure you can find some political nonsense if you look hard enough, but who cares when you have great fight scenes, lovely sceneries, a great (but basic) story and brilliant well written characters.

We even get a villain that you understand, sympathise with and even feel a sting of ""ah, too bad"" about him.

This is how you make an action movie! Great stuff Marvel!

The points I deduct is due to the movie not being that amazing. They pull the heroes journey of sure, but we have also seen it done better. Sound is great, but not amazing, directing is great, but not amazing, etc. Etc. Everything about this movie is high class, greatly done, and well performed, but it is not on top, it is not amazing nor perfect.

I also have a few objections about the background story and the ending, but I am keeping this spoiler free so...

8/10. This is a great movie and highly entertaining, and definitely worth the ticket price. Go see and get your faith in Marvel restored.","Marvel has not done much good lately. 2 horrible TV shows, and 1 bad TV show.

659,659,"With Shang-Chi, Marvel presents their first Asian superhero in a good and cultural way.","Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is a new superhero movie in the Marvel film series. The film is directed and written in part by Destin Daniel Cretton, the director of Short Term 12 and Just Mercy.

The film is about Shaun (Simu Liu), who tries to put his past behind him and just wants to enjoy his life with his best friend Katy (Awkwafina). When the mysterious organization the Ten Rings finds Shaun, he is forced to confront his past after all. To do this, he must take his birth name Shang-Chi again, to protect Katy and his sister Xialing (Meng'er Zhang) from the actions of the Ten Rings and their leader Xu WenWu the Mandarin (Tony Chiu-Wai Leung) who is also Shaun. His father.

This film is Marvel's first superhero film starring an Asian actor. Furthermore, with this film they also bring out the Asian culture and fighting styles well. For this they have used other movies like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon as an example. Fans of this film can recognize moments that refer back to these films. They portray the fight scenes where characters fight each other with Asian fighting styles well and entertainingly. The art of the Asian fighting style is somewhat overshadowed when characters use more supernatural powers in the film. Fight scenes where this happens are less exciting and entertaining than scenes where characters fight each other in more normal ways.

At one point, the film also feels like you're watching a live-action mix of the Asian animation shows Pokémon and Avatar: The Last Airbender. These scenes provide some extra comedy and are especially more entertaining for younger viewers. The movies and costumes of the film cast also help with the emergence of Asian culture in the film. The visual effects are also put to good use in the film. Except for a few scenes, it can be seen that they have used a green screen for the background, but fortunately this is not disturbing in the film. Creatures can also be returned before the start of the film. A bit redundant on a few action scenes with 3D effects in the film.

The acting is well done by the film cast. Simu Liu took to Twitter to ask Marvel to play the part, with both parties quickly making a good deal. Simu Liu comes across as good and charismatic as the lead of the film and further conveys the action sequences beautifully. Along with Awkwafina, he also has good chemistry in the film and together provide good appropriate humor. The comedy also doesn't overshadow all the dramatic aspects in the film, which sometimes does happen. Tony Chiu-Wai Leung also portrays the villain of the film in a good and sympathetic way, so that as a viewer you understand why he does what he is doing to me. This film is also only his first English-language role in an American film. Although this is only his first time, he still delivers good and appropriate acting.

It depends a lot on the visual effects, its main characters can be funny but not nice, the story does not generate much interest and we have seen the fights many times and in a better way in almost any film produced in Hong Kong, Indonesia or Thailand of the last twenty years. The only thing that saves this film is the karaoke scene that is unexpectedly welcome. The rest is routine, mediocre, tiring and bland.","Let's agree that it is a bad movie from multiple points of view.

Marvel's Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is much more than the trailer/teaser revealed! First ten minutes or so or so in chinese! And throwing a lot of chinese terms (slang?) in there as well - throughout! That gives it a touch of authenticity. How immigrants in America or anywhere else in the world grew up.

I think it's a good thing to have such a major and big representation of Asian characters, especially nowadays with Anti-Asian hate/crime rising. The film had a pure theatrical release, instead of the Black Widow treatment (which also was available on Disney plus and the cinemas at the same time) The movie does not have that as a topic, it is entertainment after all, but in every promo and interview that the actors were involved it was something that was mentioned.

Secondly, the cast is awesome, I really like Akwafina in her role, she is very funny. Also I like Simu Lu as main character he is charismatic person. But my favourite is one character from past film of MCU (don't want to give spoiler). Thirdly, I like how the atmosphere of ancient Chinese culture was shown, but for me I want more. Fourthly, the fighting is good too.

672,672,Chinese culture goes to the world,,
673,673,Another fabulous addition to MCU's Phase 4!,"The much-awaited Shangi Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings released today in theatres. It follows the journey of Shang Chi (Simu Liu), the son of the famed MCU villain the Mandarin, who revolts against his father to fight evil.

The first stand-alone film featuring an Asian American superhero, Shang Chi understandably stands out with its close combat sequences. All the actors and especially Simu Liu have undergone extensive martial arts training and it shows, with a sensational sequence on a moving bus in San Francisco and another on a bamboo scaffolding in Macau, the standouts.

Awkwafina and a surprise returning character from the MCU provide genuine, sarcasm-laced comedy that adds another wonderful layer to the experience. Cameos from Benedict Wong and Ronnie Chieng also manage to leave the audience in spits.

Without stooping to cultural appropriation, with an all-Asian crew, director Destin Daniel Cretton pays rich tribute to Chinese heritage at every turn. Hong Kong's superstars Tony Leung and Michelle Yeoh are electric in their roles and the fact that they don't seem to have lost a step with age, acing their action sequences, shows their dedication as performers.

Regarded as one of the finest actor's Chinese cinema has every produced, Tony Leung stamps his class all over the film, giving an engrossing, captivating performance as the dreaded leader of the Ten Rings.

His inner moral dilemmas and love/hate relationship with his children are portrayed brilliantly by the man nicknamed 'Small Tiger' among the Five Tiger Generals of Hong Kong Cinema

The flashback sequences help to build up Shang Chi as a character and intricately captures his upbringing as the heir-apparent to a genocidal megalomaniac, and how despite wanting nothing to do with his father's murderous tendencies, as his son, he is inadvertently drawn to the Mandarin's world of violence and carnage.

The films delves into mystical elements towards the climax and with two surprise-laden post-credit sequences tie into both Doctor Strange's world of Mystic Arts as well as a possible connection that the Ten Rings has to alien technology.

As always, the way weaves in each individual fim character to the wonderful tapestry that makes up each of its Phases is a joy in itself.

It is due to the well-written characters and the nuanced acting of its performers that Shang Chi stands out while the eye-catching CGI and elaborately chorographer action sequences add more gloss to the end product.

Another wonderful new addition to the MCU world and hopefully this paves the way for more ethnicities being represented in the universe as time goes on.

674,674,Miscast,"I'm sorry but the leading man here is a definite miscast. Or is it because Tony Leung and Awkwfina stole the show? Hmmmmmm......

While the MCU movies are getting too formulaic I'm hesitant to say the next 10 year is starting out rather uninteresting. Shang Chi is basically a Chinese cash grab in the lineage of Black Panther. It is uninspiring, routine and CGI oriented.

Back to casting the main lead, I'm suggesting either John Cho (star trek, Cowboy Bobep,) or Chang Chen (Dune) would be an upgrade. While Falan Chen is sufficient the role is a thankless one. As to the story I would love to see more of grandma and take out Ben Kingsley's.

I mean Hawkeye series is better, if how so ever slightly. I understand the fantastic elements are tributes to the Chinese culture. Of course Kingsley and that strange pet is trying hard to be comedic but is rather forced. Overall it's a surface scratcher only. So disappointed.","I'm sorry but the leading man here is a definite miscast. Or is it because Tony Leung and Awkwfina stole the show? Hmmmmmm......

679,679,Precious ... ten times,"Of course I am just riffing off, teasing and making fun of certain things with my summary line. Though there is some truth in there too - especially if you consider the last third of the movie - quite fantastical, pun intended.

But there is so much more here. And while you may have seen the bus scene already (I imagine many times), it still is quite the highlight and works wonders! Because there is even more to it than the trailer/teaser revealed! As is with the plot and the characters of the movie.

I was able to watch it on an Imax screen and let me tell you ... wow! But also wow and much respect to Marvel and Feige and anyone involved that they dared to make the first ten minutes or so in chinese! And throwing a lot of chinese terms (slang?) in there as well - throughout! That gives it a touch of authenticity. How immigrants in America or anywhere else in the world grew up.

It is also nice and while I am prone to be sarcastic, I really think it's a good thing to have such a major and big representation - especially nowadays with Anti-Asian hate/crime rising. All because of people blaming China and people of China for a virus ... the movie does not have that as a topic, it is entertainment after all, but in every promo and interview that the actors were involved it was something that was mentioned.

I am a bit biased when it comes to the MCU and this did get a pure theatrical release, instead of the Black Widow treatment (which also was available on Disney plus and the cinemas at the same time).

681,681,Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,,
682,682,The best Marvel movie so far...,"Having seen the trailer for the 2021 Marvel action movie ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" I must admit that of course I was going to watch it, but I feared it would just be another run-of-the-mill-over-the-top-CGI-fest-but-barred-of-proper-contents Marvel movie. Yet, I opted to sit down and watch it, on the notion that it was a Marvel movie. But also because of the cast that starred in it.

And yeah, this movie was over the top in terms of CGI. Of course it was, because it is a Marvel movie after all. But luckily this movie broke the formula of the archetypical Marvel movie and this actually turned out to be the best Marvel movie so far. Well, at least in my opinion. Why? Well, because of the storyline and the fact that it mixed Asian culture and lore into the Marvel cinematic universe, and it was a much needed addition to an otherwise Western-focused series of movies.

The storyline told in ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"", as written by Dave Callaham, Destin Daniel Cretton and Andrew Lanham was certainly entertaining. And the movie didn't really have a dull moment, despite the fact that it was a movie that ran for 132 minutes. I thoroughly enjoyed the entire movie from beginning to end. And for me, this was a storyline with proper contents to it, that also included interesting characters and creatures.

Visually then ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" blew me away. The CGI team really worked their magic with this movie and brought it to life in a very visually fulfilling way. Lots of nice details and jaw-dropping special effects. And the creature designs in the movie were off the charts, I really enjoyed seeing those brought to life on the screen.

The character gallery in ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" was interesting, and that applies for both the villain and good guy side.

And they had such a great cast ensemble put together for ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"", with the likes of Asian cinema heavy weighters such as Tony Chiu-Wai Leung, Michelle Yeoh and Wah Yuen. But the movie was also nicely carried by Simu Liu, whom I was not familiar with prior to this movie. And also having Awkwafina in the movie was just brilliant, because she put on a spot on performance with her comedy sidekick character. And it was interesting and nice to see Ben Kingsley return to reprise his character of Trevor Slattery.

""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" is a good combination of action and narrative storytelling, which made for a very wholesome movie. And it should be said that the action sequences were breathtaking to behold, so very, very nicely choreographed and executed on the screen, taking that traditional Wuxia elements seen in Asian movies and mixing it in with the archetypical Marvel Western-based superhero movies.

I was more than genuinely entertained by ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" and it is certainly a movie that bolsters Marvel's hold for me, as their movies tend to be super flashy with spectacular effects, but rather hollow in terms of proper entertainment and storytelling.

My rating of ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" lands on a well-deserved nine out of ten stars.

684,684,Ten Years too Late,,
685,685,Indeed legendary,"It's been ten years since Shang-Chi(Liu, charming, stoic) last saw his father, and leader of the criminal empire The Ten Rings, Wenwu(Leung, charismatic enough that we feel a lot of empathy for him, even when he does terrible things that we desperately want him to stop doing). That was also when he last spent time with his sister, Xialing(Zhang, a badass who deserves more screen time. Honestly, I'd be very surprised if she didn't, in future projects). He's joined by his friend Katy(Awkwafina, quirky, providing a lot of comic relief, something I'm told she's in general adept at), for what can best be described as a tense reunion, which allows the movie to really mine the family melodrama, one of the best elements it has. I won't give away exactly what the antagonist intends to do, only that our hero has to stop him. However, he has to figure out how, maybe even if, that is even possible.

Not quite, yet almost ""Black Panther for Asian audiences"", this does a lot for representation(including for women. Some of the best characters in this are female. In addition to the two that I've already mentioned, there is also Ying Nan(Yeoh, wise)), it is positively drenched in Chinese culture(the third act, while in ways it feels like it belongs to a completely different film than the first two, takes an especially deep dive into that. Ultimately, it is presented through a Western lens, and clearly we need to go further in this direction, still, it is a big deal that they put so much of it in an estimated $150 to 200 million major blockbuster, which will be seen by millions of people who would never consider watching an art picture, especially one focusing on a group they don't belong to), to the point where countless times, when it makes sense, major characters in this speak Mandarin to each other, rather than English, which it is subtitled into. And ""don't worry"", for those who think that the following is important: there are white people on screen, and they aren't made out to be ""less than"".

The action(each sequence of which feels distinct, belongs with the rest, and is memorable) pays tribute to many different kinds of martial arts films, acknowledging that they are standing on the shoulders of giants. Jackie Chan, wuxia, etc. The choreography is matched in skill by the cinematography. Not only are we seeing incredible fighting, the camera is dynamic, celebrating and highlighting how incredible it is. That *is* why you hire Bill Pope, the director of photography on the Matrix trilogy, two of Sam Raimi's Spider-Man entries, Darkman and Team America. The special effects are excellent. There are some issues with pacing, and certainly a chunk of this is composed almost entirely of flashbacks.

This features relatively brief but highly concentrated, surprisingly graphic gore(you know, there was a time when the fact that it's happening to beings that clearly are not human, wasn't enough to get away with this kind of thing with a PG-13 rating. Pepperidge Farm remembers), as well as a little strong language. I recommend this to any fan of comic book movie adaptations, and people passionate about diversity hiring. 8/10.","It's been ten years since Shang-Chi(Liu, charming, stoic) last saw his father, and leader of the criminal empire The Ten Rings, Wenwu(Leung, charismatic enough that we feel a lot of empathy for him, even when he does terrible things that we desperately want him to stop doing).

It was that good in my humble opinion. Visually it was just stunning, great CGI's, very well choreographed fighting scenes, and a story that was most entertaining to watch. Some might find it over the top but it's a Marvel so what do you expect? To me this is one of Marvels best movies yet if not the best. The acting was good as well, and that from the whole cast. I never heard of Shang-Chi before but from now he has one more fan. Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings won't disappoint a lot of people, unless you're just not into this genre of movies. A must see for the fans.","Without spoiling anything as this story stands by itself there's going to be a sequel and I really look forward to that. It was that good in my humble opinion.

690,690,A Marvel for the whole family.,"""The US government was almost toppled by a pretender named after an orange."" Wenwu (Tony Leung)

This quote is typical of the light-hearted but also serious addition to the MCU that is Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings. Although Marvel has always been less serious than DC, this time it leaves Superman and Batman to cry in their capes. Sweet superhero Sean/Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) has more humanity than almost any other hero, and he uses his martial arts only when pressed.

The opening sequence on a bus (you can see the bad coming from other cinematic bus rides such as in Nobody) is rousing and entertaining. It has a fight sequence I laughed through because of its ballet-like composition but satisfying because it sets up character and motivation.

When things get heavy, and they do because Sean must confront and potentially kill his 1000-year-old mobster dad, Wenwu, Awkwafina's Katy, Sean's girlfriend, is there with amusing one-liners throughout the adventure, right down to a life-saving shot in the big ending battle scene.

Director Destin Daniel Cretton deftly orchestrates his fights and his characters' lines with the authority of a much more seasoned filmmaker. He never loses sight of the central motif-the affirmation of family primacy, so that the potential chaos of a giant cast and multiple plot strands hosts a unity glued by character and dialogue.

Shang-Chi is a Marvel for the whole family and especially the cinephiles curious how The Marvel Cinematic Universe can be so diverse, so entertaining, and so perfect a purveyor of our heroic fantasies.","""The US government was almost toppled by a pretender named after an orange.""

692,692,The legend of the ten Marvel movies a year for all eternity.,"'Shang-Chi And The Legend Of The Ten Rings (2021)' is, essentially, exactly what you expect it to be. Not only does it feel like a Marvel movie, it feels like a literal Disney movie as well. This is often detrimental to the overall affair, as the piece should have been much more unique than it ultimately is, and it makes for a much less interesting watch overall. However, the formula it follows has provided plenty of success in the past; this time is no exception. Its highs are where you'd expect them to be, as are its lows, and there is an undeniable sense of fun, albeit cookie-cutter fun, to be had. The film is an entertaining action adventure that follows a young man whose criminal father calls him and his sister back home in order to lay siege to the mystical village he believes is holding his wife, the protagonist's mother, hostage. The villain's motivation is a little underexplored yet entirely understandable. It comes from a believable emotional place and is more satisfying because of it. The relationship between the lead and his no-good dad isn't explored as much as it could be, though, and the flick generally has a bit of a theming issue. The piece tries to tie its events directly into the wants and needs of its lead characters, but it does so in an unsatisfyingly half-baked way and honestly would probably have been better if it played itself as more of a straightforward adventure ala most of the 'Mission: Impossible (1996-)' series. Still, the touches of character development are appreciated and each lead player is written to be as likeable as possible. This, combined with the amicable performances, means that you care about the heroes even though you don't have all that much reason to. This keeps you invested in their stories throughout. The highlight of the entire affair is, for sure, its action. For the most part, the picture stays towards the right end of the practical to CG spectrum. The fights are never exactly realistic, per se, but they're based on competent choreography and clean camerawork. They're, more often than not, really entertaining. Sadly, the flick inches closer and closer towards the wrong end of the aforementioned spectrum the longer it goes on. By the time it reaches its finale (which gives me major 'Fast And Furious Presents Hobbs And Shaw (2019)' vibes for some reason), it's clear that the balance it previously achieved is going to go out of the window. Sure enough, its climactic battle is an entirely computer-generated affair; it isn't all that compelling and goes directly against what made the movie so enjoyable to begin with. No matter how hard it tries to disguise it, it still ends with a big blue beam in the sky. Still, the finale isn't exactly bad. It's just annoyingly intangible and feels a little forced in, even (as do the rather cringe-worthy post-credits scenes). Ultimately, this is a generic yet entertaining experience. Its charming acting and exciting action are clearly its highlights, and its weakest aspects are still decent enough. It's a good movie. However, I can't deny that Marvel fatigue is becoming more and more pertinent in my mind. You know what you're going to get before you get it. Plus, the studio's insistence that it has to perforate every single outing with references to other, almost entirely irrelevant fare is really annoying. Although most of their movies are at least okay, I find myself not caring at all about them. That's sad, really, considering that the MCU has produced some genuinely great pictures in the past. 7/10.","'Shang-Chi And The Legend Of The Ten Rings (2021)' is, essentially, exactly what you expect it to be.

693,693,Fun martial arts action-comedy with some dragon ex machina,"After a flashback, this movie jumps to a couple of slackers, Shaun and Katy, with Shaun proving during a wild bus ride that he is much more than a car attendant. Soon they're on a globe hoping adventure with world-saving dimensions.

The martial arts choreography is terrific, from the opening forest fight through that fantastic bus bit to the final hand-to-hand battle (followed by the big special effects battle seemingly required in every Marvel film). Fights are funny and exciting and that final battle is truly suspenseful.

The cast is also excellent. Awkwafina is as funny as ever, Michelle Yeoh and Tony Leung bring all their seasoned expertise to their roles, and the actors are don't know are also first rate.

Although ... in the case of Simu Liu, who plays Shaun/Shang-Chi, I have no strong opinion. He's a pleasant every man who handles the action scenes well but seems less mythic hero than ""genial best friend of the main character."" With all the other talent on screen he doesn't manage to leave much of an impression, but on the bright side I don't object to him.

The story is fun, the movie does a good job of mixing humor, action, and tragical reminiscences the pace is terrific, and man there are some great fights. Recommended.","After a flashback, this movie jumps to a couple of slackers, Shaun and Katy, with Shaun proving during a wild bus ride that he is much more than a car attendant.

694,694,my eyes couldn't handle the sheer awesomeness on the screen,"Watch this in IMAX!!!! The entire movie has an expanded aspect ratio. You're watching about 70% of the image on normal screens, plus on way smaller screens with worse speakers. I promise, it's worth it

WOWOWOWOWOW. This movie blew me away. I love it. A LOT. From beginning to end. Everything. I walked out of the movie so hyped, silent-screaming under my mask as i walked to the car. It's been a while since i walked out of a movie this happy. I have so much to say.

I love the MCU (a lot), but there are a few things that are frequently lacking. One of them is good fight scenes. They always have awesome action scenes, but specifically fight scenes are usually pretty good, only great in a few movies like civil war and winter soldier. And in general, fight scenes in American movies pale in comparison to Asian cinema (Ip man, The Raid Redemption, anything Jackie Chan).

The fight scenes in this movie.... how do i describe it... amazing martial arts that's fast but clear, filmed in creative and astonishing ways without a hint of shaky cam or quick cuts, against stunningly beautiful backdrops... phenomenal. And they continuously focus on the fights instead of cutting to a different scene after 10 seconds like i've noticed in the MCU.

This is BY FAR the best fighting in the MCU and it's not even close. Has to be up there with the John Wick series and Netflix's Daredevil as some of the best we've seen in America lately. I loved the first major fight scene so much that i was worried it would be the best one of the movie, far too early. Lol. I be stupid sometimes

Another frequent flaw in the MCU is lack of compelling villain. Nope. Awesome awesome awesome. That's all i'll say.

Another of my frequent complaints is that the musical scores, with some exceptions, don't stand out. I think they heard. They're on a good streak with the shows and Black Widow. It's not as amazing as the Loki score but i liked it. It felt unique to this new franchise.

Still so much more to say, need to go faster. This is one of the best, maybe THE best, story in the MCU, especially the way it's told. I loved all the characters, i loved all the casting choices, i loved the performances. There are scenes of dialogue that gave me goosebumps. All the emotional moments hit. All the callbacks hit. There isn't anything that didn't work for me. There's no such thing as a perfect movie, but mannnnnn.

Lmao i didn't mention the cinematography. Why would i wait this long? It's MESMERIZING. A lot. Throughout. It's candy for your eyes.

It's also nice to see well-written comedy with jokes relevant to the scene and characters, that feels organic. As opposed to the ""insert joke here"" method we've been seeing more of, especially in Far From Home.

What's the opposite of formulaic? That's this movie. I never knew what to expect next (helps that i didn't watch a single trailer, they ruin movies). Definitely doesn't feel like a typical MCU movie. It has it's own unique tone and feel and character.

Continuing what i said in my headline, i have this thing where i get goosebumps and start tearing up, not from an emotional moment, but from a scene being so incredible, especially action scenes. Don't know why it happens, don't know if it happens to other ppl. Maybe it's partly because i can't risk blinking. That happened in this movie numerous times. Like ""this is the coolest thing i've ever seen in my life."" hyperbole, but mannnnn

after endgame finished phase 3 (yes i know spider-man), i was so happy and satisfied with the MCU. But i wasn't sure they could ever recapture that magic again. I knew i would watch everything and it would probably mostly be awesome. But i wasn't expecting top-tier stuff any more. Lol. I be stupid sometimes. I am ecstatic to have that notion obliterated. As of now, this is a top 6 MCU movie for me. Wow

All in all, i adore this movie. You may wonder why i wouldn't give it a 10 after all this raving. 10s are super rare for me, only 13 of them, and i watch thousands of movies. Interstellar, inception, mad max fury road, etc. Movies that shouldn't even be called movies. My 9s are rare too, they are my favorite movies. 10s are my favorites of my favorites. Only superhero movies i've given 10s are dark knight, dark knight rises and civil war.

If you're still reading, wow you're awesome! I think this is my longest review other than Interstellar.

I'm still in such a good mood. I can't wait to watch it again, in IMAX. I want to wait a week so it feels fresher, but i might not be able to!

We get some absolutely amazing fight scenes which seem right out of a classic Chinese martial arts movie. My only complaint is that it is a bit too long.

703,703,Highly entertaining,"Greetings from Lithuania.

""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" (2021) is definitely one of my favorite Marvel movies. I loved fighting scenes - this is first ting what separated this movie from the bunch. Also i liked the story (i haven't read comics). Acting was good by everyone. Action scenes (and there are plenty of them) were simply amazing. This is a one spectacular looking movie.

Overall, superbly paced at running time 2 h 5 min this movie never dragged. Special effects were amazing, as well as technical stuff of this movie including terrific cinematography. ""Shang-Chi"" is a superbly entertaining popcorn escapism.","Greetings from Lithuania.

704,704,Shang Empty,"Sorry for the delay.

Here we go...

I'm not feeling this movie. It starts with promise but It lost me after Wong vs Abomb.

The fighting is exciting. The movie lacks excitement though. It's a plain dull movie.

It's about a Karate master and... yeah the movie lost me and I have know idea what it's about. This is the first mcu film that I lost interest for midway. Even Im3 wasn't so bad because I lost interest from the very beginning.

Gotg2, mcu Spiderman 1/2 and IM3 are still the worse in mcu. Shang Chi just joined the club.

A movie so full of emptiness that it makes an empty box jealous

I'm not sure how this is a 7. Fans and the average movie goer should also be held responsible for horrible movies.

This movie ain't a 7 even if you watched this movie as blind and drunk.

They tried to be funny by having Wong be rude by drinking the couple's drink at the end credit scene. That wasn't funny at all. Wizard or not.

Speaking of funny, I didn't laugh once. When I used to watch these movies in theatres, the audience often told me when I should have laughed. I watched it at home, therefore I didn't know my cue of when to laugh.

The mcu needs to chill with the daddy issue plot

THOR Loki daddy issue Black Panta daddy issues Stark Daddy issues Star lord Daddy issues Ultron daddy issues Nebula and Gamora daddy issues Shang daddy issue Wasp daddy issues Scott langs daughter Daddy issues

No one has mommy issues.

Don't watch this movie.","Sorry for the delay.

705,705,Masterpiece...,"""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" is an Action - Fantasy movie in which we watch a new era of Marvel Studios rise with Shang-Chi, the master of Kung Fu. He has to face his past involving him with the Ten Rings organization and crate his future accordingly.

I have to admit that I had my doubts about this movie but I was proven very wrong since it's an amazing movie. It has a beautiful and very interesting plot that keeps you in tense through its whole duration consisted of plenty of action and nice CGIs. For one more time Marvel succeeded on creating a nice atmosphere and connecting the previous movies with this one with many Easter Eggs so, we expect more in the near future. The interpretation of Simu Liu who played as Shaun / Shang-Chi was simply outstanding and he made the difference. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Tony Chiu-Wai Leung's who played as Xu Wenwu, Michelle Yeoh's who played as Ying Nan, Meng'er Zhang's who played as Xialing and Awkwafina's who played as Katy. The comic relief role of Ben Kingsley as Trevor Slattery was a brilliant idea that also gave something different in the movie. Finally, I have to say that ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" is an amazing movie and I strongly recommend everyone to watch it, especially the fans of Marvel.","""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" is an Action - Fantasy movie in which we watch a new era of Marvel Studios rise with Shang-Chi, the master of Kung Fu.

711,711,"Epic, stunning, and a strong powerhouse story.","5 out of 5 stars.

Shang-Chi and the legend of the Ten Rings is an awesome and exciting mcu film that brings the stunning world with the asian culture. I will say i enjoyed this more than the previous mcu film Black Widow. Shang Chi introduces a new mcu character played by Simu Liu. And Awkwafina which is also a fun addition. While they are being chased by an organization called ten rings. Lead by his father Tony Leung. While Shang Chi learns his abilities and the ten rings. Before his father is trying to use that power for a personal reason.

Great epic plot. Shang Chi and Katy (Awkwafina) enter a hidden world Ta Lao where there is magical mythical creatures. Is like a wow stunning moment when you first see Wakanda in Black Panther. The film does give an emotional story build up and a villain that can be relatable.

The cast ensemble is great. Simu Liu did great with the character along with Awkwafina as his friend. Meng'er Zhang, Michelle Yeoh, Benedict Wong, Florian Munteanu, and Tong Leung all did great.

The set designs and visual effects are stunning and great. Can be colorful at moments. The music score was good as well. The action sequences are great and exciting. Every set piece had an awesome martial arts choreography which was well shot with the cinematography. Director did a great job in capturing the action and fight sequences. Even with the epic climax of the dragon battle.

There are two mid and post credit scene which sets up for further films and has a fun nod to the mcu.

I will say Shang Chi is a great exciting addition and i found the film to be very fast moving. Action packed. And a great family conflict story that is emotionally driven.","5 out of 5 stars.

712,712,A Marvel-ous martial arts joy,"Showing no signs of slowing down hot off the heels of Black Widow, a raft of well-received Disney+ series and arriving not too far in front of the hotly anticipated The Eternals, Marvel continues to put in work that puts many other wheelhouses too shame, with the marital arts infused Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, yet another entry into the brands increasingly loaded catalogue of quality blockbuster releases.

It's hard to pinpoint exactly what Marvel keep doing to maintain the momentum that started all those years ago with 2008's Iron Man, it's absolutely correct when many say a lot of these origin stories and event pictures follow a very set formula from A to B, but with an ability to attract some of the best actors working in the industry today and handpicking a raft of some of the most exciting Hollywood filmmakers around, Marvel have once more struck gold with the incredibly fun and inventive Shang-Chi.

Quite possibly the most visually sumptuous Marvel film yet, sometimes feeling as if Marvel has meet with Ang Lee/Yimou Zhang and in my mind the Marvel film that features the best choregraphed action scenes yet from the spectacle heavy brand, Shang-Chi is a big screen blast that is freshly directed by the upcoming Destin Daniel Cretton who here has got his just rewards after his great debut Short Term 12 and the sadly undervalued The Glass Castle came before this big-budgeted ride.

Infusing his film with a great energy and charm that is enhanced by the work of leads Simu Liu (in a career launching turn) as our likable hero Shaun/Shang-Chi, Awkwafina (doing her usual but fun schtick) as Shaun's bestie Katy and Tony Leung as the unfortunate villain of the piece Xu Wenwu, Cretton has turned out to be the perfect choice to start off the cinematic journey of the fist swinging Shang-Chi and helps instill in his film some nice differences to what we've come to expect from comic book blockbusters of the modern era.

Most notably for the film is the exciting use of hand to hand combat that is delivered spectacularly in two stand out sequences on board a moving bus and then bettered alongside a high rise building in Macau, both these set pieces are easily some of the most noteworthy of any Marvel film yet while also benefiting the film other than its Asian infused eccentricities is the fun relationship between Shang-Chi and Katy than never bothers with adding extra baggage to add weight to their believable and fun friendship.

If there was a major drawback to Shang-Chi's many wins it is in an overdrawn finale, a major problem many have acknowledged previously when it comes to Marvel films, Cretton and his team can't quite stick the landing for Shang-Chi with it being a little too long in the tooth for its own good and slightly overblown and while it features some incredible imagery and technical wizardry, the films rip-roaring start and strong middle section gives way too something lesser.

Final Say -

Another huge win for Marvel who have here with the help of director Destin Daniel Cretton and his talented cast, created an instantly likable cinematic universe that provides the comic kings with one of their most unique and exciting playgrounds yet.

714,714,Yet another superb stand-alone superhero flick in MCEU's kitty.,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (2021) : Brief Review -

Yet another superb stand-alone superhero flick in MCEU's kitty. MCEU's new phase never looked so promising but their products are delivering Better than expected. That Spider Man flick in 2019, right after Endgame, changed many perceptions about Marvel's future and even though couple of their recent series like 'Wanda Vision' and 'Loki' couldn't emerge as clear winners, they have set a solid base for upcoming new stories. Shang-Chi is a new start by all means. Not only because it comes under new phase but mainly because it is a stand-alone film and with a new superhero who is more like using traditional combat methods along with ancient superpowers. When Captain America or Black Panther begun as Stand-alone films, they promised too much and thankfully fulfilled it. Shang-Chi does the same. It may not promise too much like Steve Rogers and Wakanda stories but the point where it ends surely gives us hints of new assembled version of superheroes in Multiverse. Shang-Chi, the master of unarmed weaponry-based Kung Fu, is forced to confront his past after being drawn into the Ten Rings organization. The film has major portion covered by Family values and hence, it may look predictable but does not bore at all. Yes, few scenes are outdated and too dramatic as if we are watching a Superhero Film made in 90s but let's just forget those weak points as Shang Chi has excelled in Visual spectacle. The screenplay could have been better in the second half when the big War was supposed to take place but it actually looks tiny one except for those two humongous dragons which might remind you of 'The Hobbit'. Performances by Simu Li, Awkwafina, Meng'er Zhang, Fala Chen, Florian Munteanu are fine according to less potential available for the roles. Actually, the humour and tone of these characters was great. They all looked normal people when they were not fighting and even though the film has ancient refrences, the character don't actually go too deep to become expressive. Director Destin Daniel Cretton seemed slightly off track in the beginning when he tries to humanise all the characters with that typically teenage humor but as the film goes ahead, he recovers from the childish entanglement. With super explosive climax he surely makes up for his mistakes, rather makes us forgive it. Overall, Shang Chi is another superb entertainer for Marvel Fanboys and even neutrals are gonna enjoy it.

715,715,This could've been great if it wasn't for the cheesy writing.,"The story was riddled with holes and plot issues. Since when does Awkwafina's pedestrian character all of a sudden get invited to become part of the MCU team? What's her super power... stupidity? Don't get me wrong, I love her, but her character was lazily written. Then there's the whole daddy issues dynamic - Shang is with him, then against, then with etc.. Then we have these ridiculous dragons fighting, where one scores some power crystals and becomes stronger! This is just infantile lazy writing. There was zero shock value or anything spectacular in the entire runtime, with tedious long middle acts and a bumbling third act. The jokes were cliched and not funny. The funniest parts were Ben Kingsley's character, (of whom was in this for what reasons??) and the ending to go Karaoke - which was the only time I actually cracked a chuckle. You'd think with three writers we'd have something cohesive and coherent. But instead of a Marvel superhero story, we got a Disney evil vs good with dragons thrown into the mix. It's as if they tried too hard to create the Asian version of Black Panther.

It's a shame, because the directing and cinematography were spot on, and great S/VFX - although a little overboard with the CGI i.e. Dragons. The martial arts choreography was outstanding (although again, overboard after the awesome bus scene), and the casting and performances were excellent, especially Leung, who pretty much carried the film on his shoulders. It's a 7/10 from me.","The story was riddled with holes and plot issues. Since when does Awkwafina's pedestrian character all of a sudden get invited to become part of the MCU team?

716,716,8 Rings out of 10,"For the first time in a couple of years, since 2019's ""Captain Marvel"" the MCU introduces us to a brand new hero. Simu Liu who, rather impressively, first asked for the role on Twitter brings us Shang-Chi in a film that perhaps does have some issues with it's ending, but ultimately is a fun, funny ride of the type Marvel have been perfecting for the last 13 years.

Talented, but somewhat aimless, Shaun (Simu Liu) lives in San Francisco working as a valet with his friend Katy (Awkwafina). When he's attacked on a bus, he's forced back into the world of his father, a ruthless terrorist Xu Wenwu (Tony Chiu-Wai Leung). First visiting his sister, then returning to the Ten Rings compound, Shang-Chi decides to use his skills to defend his late mothers sacred homeland against invasion from his father and for control of ten mystical arm rings, weapons that grant their owner immortality and unearthly power.

If ""Black Widow"" was considered a wobble for the MCU, despite the fact I thought that it's a perfectly fine film, then it was important to come back with something that was undeniably excellent. ""Shang-Chi"" was that. It's the perfect balance of humour and action that Marvel have established over the last few years. The action too is tweaked slightly, to more closely resemble the types of Asian led action films that we've seen previously, be that the Jackie Chan style bus fight, or the ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon""-esque flashback fight between Shang Chi's parents. There's some lovely links to the wider MCU, including a return for Benedict Wong's Wong and for Trevor Slattery, Ben Kingsley's ""Iron Man 3"" character whose masquerading role as The Mandarin was one of the MCU's most divisive moments.

It's not perfect. The ending is perhaps a little rushed and lacking a moment or two of redemption earning for Xu Wenwu, but the peaks at the future for the character, and for the 10 Rings organisation is an interesting addition, plus our first real step on what might be the route to the next big bad. Excellent stuff.","For the first time in a couple of years, since 2019's ""Captain Marvel"" the MCU introduces us to a brand new hero.

You have seen it all before: physics-defying martial arts, monsters who look like the recently swallowed strings of LED Christmas lights, conflicted heroes with wise-cracking 'comic relief' sidekicks (an awful Aquafina and an even more awful Ben Kingsley), giant melees featuring a variety of glowing weapons (but no blood), hyper-kinetic and hyper-implausible car/motorcycle chases, and a lot of clichéd wisecracks, tough-guy dialogue, poseur slo-mo, and heroic vogueing (we're treated to the venerable three-point power landing/slide a number of times). The only novel thing the film has to offer is the excellent rendering of mythological beasts from Chinese culture; otherwise, it's an overly-long (132 minutes, which is 120 minutes too much Aquafina), derivative, repetitive, and ultimately boring entry in the bloated, jejune Micky Mouse-Marvel superhero franchise.","Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) discovers that his all-powerful and millennium-old father is about to launch an attack against the magical village where Shang-Chi's mother was born in the likely mistaken belief that his wife is not dead but is rather being held captive (there is more to the plot than one sentence can sum up but what does it matter... the story is just scaffolding for the special effects).

720,720,Promises good things for MCU's Phase Four,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings stars Simu Liu in the lead role alongside such heavy names as Tony Leung and Michelle Yeoh in this latest installment to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Liu's Shang-Chi must come to his own as the son of the legendary Mandarin (Leung), the owner of the Ten Rings.

I like this film's style most of all. Director Destin Daniel Cretton mixes Chinese wuxia settings and aesthetics with Hong Kong wire kung fu inspired action set pieces, while still keeping it feeling like a Marvel film. There's a surprising amount of callbacks and nods to the larger Marvel universe, pleasing dedicated fans, but the film is still able to stand on its own feet and introduce us to its hero.

Kudos also to the whole filming for these action scenes. Very little shaky cam or jump cuts, especially for the hand to hand scenes. Exactly as it should be. I'd dare to say that this film has some of, if not the best action set pieces in all of MCU.

One of the most thrilling and visually spectacular end battles as well, come to think of it.

Furthermore, the acting is solid, especially from Liu, Leung and Awkwafina, who plays Shang-Chi's American friend. Meng'er Zhang as Xialing, Shang-Chi's younger sister, was perhaps my only real gripe with the film. I could have used either a bit more edge to her or alternatively a lot less. Now she seemed to flipflop between relatable and aggravating.

All in all, not the best Marvel movie by any means, but that's a really high bar to clear. I can simply say that based on this, I'm very optimistic about MCU's continued future.","Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings stars Simu Liu in the lead role alongside such heavy names as Tony Leung and Michelle Yeoh in this latest installment to the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

721,721,The Master of kung fu was really good but not as good as I wanted it to be.,"It was better than the proceeding Marvel movie Black Window. More exceeding the expectations of a Marvel movie. Shang-Chi feels like the marvel movie experience is starting to get back to the normal of the theme ride Martian Scorsese believes they are (I can't disagree, just note that's what I want)

In comparison Shang-Chi is a lower level character. I am a fan of Marvel comics but got more of the references to the Marvel Cinematic Universe in this movie than to the direct comic book references. Those Marvel cinematic universe references were amazing enough to get over the fact that the obvious comic book ones went over my head. I mean this movie's connection to other movies is great fanfare that makes me love it more. So really cool cameos happen that actually move the story along.

I did like what they did with the Mandarin here but do feel they copied and paste a lot of things into the story of Shang-Chi to make a complete movie for a lower level character. From the little I know of the character he more fits into those Netflix's shows they did a few years back but change him enough to justify a blockbuster.

They did succeed in making Shang-Chi's background more fuller. The relationship between him and his father and sister was beautiful, complex and more importantly, never bored me and of course Awkafina as the comedy relief and best friend to Shang-Chi was strategic gold. The story for the background was not that full. It's really a character driven movie for without the amazing performances from a group of actors who know their stuff this story would fall short.

Note, I loved the fact that Michelle Yeoh was in this movie and that gives it a lot, but she's done way better in less effective films (but she most likely got a huge paycheck from Disney just to wave her hands around).

The special effects were good in this flick. I was impress with what was used to make the final conflict and I was convince that the dude from Kim's Convenience was a master of kung fu

Its a good movie but it did not live up to my high expectations of it. It gave me a lot of cool things but really did not give me anything I did not see before, in movies that did it better, but if it's about anything I did spend the rest of the day pretending I knew Kung fu.","It was better than the proceeding Marvel movie Black Window.

723,723,Finally a new kind of marvel story,,
724,724,An easy watch that fits into the MCU well,"A San Francisco valet finds his past catching up with him in spectacular fashion.

This is an entertaining superhero adventure story with an Asian martial arts theme and a number of entertaining scenes.

Like many introductions to superhero characters there is a bit of backstory to go through and this film does it with flashback sequences in a similar way to 'Black Panther'. These are mixed with the action, humour and unfolding narrative of the present day plot. Additionally there is some important exposition added relating to the Marvel multiverse. Personally I think everything depicted could have been done in more than one movie, and not so rushed, but that's just a personal preference. What is presented is not complicated in anyway, but very simplified, presumably so that it can be established quickly and the likes of Shang-Chi and Katy can share screens with other MCU characters as soon as possible.

The tone and general feel of the movie also reminds me of the approach taken with 'Black Panther', particularly when it focusses on a location that, like Wakanda, mixes the sights and sounds of regional culture with the sci-fi fantasy. It has obviously been written carefully so that it displays imagery associated with far-Eastern culture like martial arts, traditional costuming, rural settings, that is marketable to a Western audience, but at the same time it avoids other commonly associated negative stereotyping like exaggerated accents, sorcery, yellow peril, bad driving, and (thankfully) gong sounds. Much of this is drenched with a liberal amount of fast-talking contemporary American humour.

There are a number of highly enjoyable scenes such as the fight sequence on the bus, the various comedy moments, virtually everything that comes out of Ben Kingsley's mouth, and all the flashback scenes. The final dinner table scene is probably my favourite.

Visually as you can imagine it is beautiful and full of top drawer cinematography, editing, and technology-driven effects. For me though the spectacle goes over-the-top, particularly in the final action sequence.

Most actors are solid such as Simu Liu, Tony Leung, Meng'er Zhang, Michelle Yeoh, Fala Chen, and Benedict Wong. The standout performances for me easily are Nora Lum and Ben Kingsley who have buckets of charisma and the advantage of all the best lines.

Overall there is little to criticise, it just feels like what Martin Scorsese described perfectly in 2019 as a theme park rather than cinema.","A San Francisco valet finds his past catching up with him in spectacular fashion.

730,730,Marvel Sprinkles a Different Flavor into the MCU,"Marvel gets mystical in this mashup of the plucky, familiar MCU character and the more stoic, legend-heavy air of wuxia films. It's a fresh mix, effectively breaking the gravity of its more serious moments with a well-timed jape while lending credence and lore to a lesser-known corner of the comic kingdom, but these crossover moments sometimes test their limits. I could see more grounded viewers being turned off by the dragons and soul-sucking demons (far cry from the feasible reality of the first Iron Man, that) while serious fans of Chinese fantasy are bucked by the constant injection of loose wit and slappy one-liners.

When it's rolling, Shang Chi does manage to toe that line and deliver something appropriately new and versatile, a good reflection of both worlds. It benefits from a tight pair of central performances (Simu Liu and Awkwafina as a team of underachieving twenty-somethings) and several big, powerful action sets (the articulated bus fight might be one of the best combat scenes Marvel's ever put out) while tying in a dangling thread or two from earlier films to provide a sense of greater connection. On several occasions, however, it's guilty of being too self-indulgent and losing the narrative. It's great to see Ben Kingsley again, adding nuance to his part in Iron Man 3, but his scenes are the main offender here; excessive and distracting and way too cute.

The action is strong, the dialogue (mostly) works, the scenery looks great, but in the big picture, Shang Chi feels small-scale and disposable. Non-completionists won't miss anything crucial if they choose to skip it.","Marvel gets mystical in this mashup of the plucky, familiar MCU character and the more stoic, legend-heavy air of wuxia films.

733,733,Marvel movie by the numbers with beautiful dragons and charming locations,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is yet another movie inspired by the Marvel universe that has constantly been inspiring the cinematic world for more than a decade now. While the movie follows the usual stereotypes, it manages to stand out with its stunning special effects and locations.

The movie revolves around Shaun, a Chinese immigrant living in the United States of America who is working as a valet with his quirky friend and soulmate Katy. One day, they get attacked by a group of assassins on a bus and only just manage to survive. Shaun immediately understands that the attack must be related to his influential estranged father. Along with Katy, he decides to team up with his tough estranged sister Xialing to find out what's going on.

This film convinces on multiple levels. First of all, the acting performances are quite quirky and convincing. Especially the ladies steal the show. Awkwafina delivers the goods as curious, dynamic and funny woman that anyone would like to have as a friend. Zhang Meng'er on the other side represents a much darker character shaped by dramatic events from the past who is much more difficult to approach with her tough, relentless and independent personality.

The expensive special effects certainly deliver the goods as well. The scenes in a fantasy world, in Ancient China and in contemporary San Francisco are all equally stunning to watch. The fantastic creatures such as dragons look impressive on the big screen.

The story might be predictable but is nevertheless entertaining from start to finish thanks to steady pace and inspired execution. You will truly care about the fates of the different characters as you are watching this film.

However, this film isn't without its occasional flaws. First of all, lead actor Simu Liu simply doesn't have the charisma of the other actresses and actors involved. Casting him was a bold choice but it didn't fully pay off in my opinion.

Up next, the movie desperately tries to connect to other characters in the Marvel Universe. The appearance of Trevor Slattery played by Ben Kingsley is completely random as it only seems to be a pretext to offer some misplaced comic relief. The mid-credit scene starts in an amusing fashion but suddenly involving Bruce Banner and Carol Danvers only seems like a weak attempt to develop a hype for potential sequels. The same goes for yet another scene after the credits that evokes more questions rather than concluding the film appropriately.

At the end of the day, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is an entertaining fantasy action film of the Marvel Universe that should appeal to faithful and occasional fans alike. It's one of the better films in the franchise but perhaps Marvel should focus on quality over quantity instead of becoming a monstrous capitalistic machine that is scarier than any gigantic dragon shown in the film.","Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is yet another movie inspired by the Marvel universe that has constantly been inspiring the cinematic world for more than a decade now.

736,736,What a film!,,
737,737,"A fun time at the movies, and that's all it really needed to be","Charming and incredibly fun- Shang-Chi may not be the best Marvel has had to offer- but it is one of their better films in some time. My main problems with the film lie in the films storyline, which to be honest, is really good, but incredibly all over the place editing wise and there is just so much of it that it feels like two movies could have been made out of it. I love that we get a more in depth look at our characters, their flaws, their regrets, the tragedy in their lives- but the editing makes it feel rather out of place at times- and takes away from the impact the film could have had and its heart. That being said, the film still manages to be very enjoyable throughout. The action scenes are absolutely incredible, the look of the film incredibly well developed- something very fresh and original for Marvel studios- and the cast are all a joy to watch- especially Simu Liu and Aquafina in the lead and supporting roles. I was skeptical of Aquafina being in a Marvel movie for sure, but she really helped the film as a whole, and honestly I would love to see more of her character in future Marvel projects. The film is entertaining, despite the pacing of the film being a bit all over the place at times. It has some brilliant, elaborate special effects that you will be gawking at on the screen, and plenty of surprises that will be bound to make you smile. In the end, Shang-Chi was a fun time for a Marvel movie- something most comic-book flicks have forgotten about recently- and i'm excited what this character has to offer in future films.

I love that we get a more in depth look at our characters, their flaws, their regrets, the tragedy in their lives- but the editing makes it feel rather out of place at times- and takes away from the impact the film could have had and its heart. That being said, the film still manages to be very enjoyable throughout. The action scenes are absolutely incredible, the look of the film incredibly well developed- something very fresh and original for Marvel studios- and the cast are all a joy to watch- especially Simu Liu and Aquafina in the lead and supporting roles. I was skeptical of Aquafina being in a Marvel movie for sure, but she really helped the film as a whole, and honestly I would love to see more of her character in future Marvel projects. The film is entertaining, despite the pacing of the film being a bit all over the place at times. It has some brilliant, elaborate special effects that you will be gawking at on the screen, and plenty of surprises that will be bound to make you smile. In the end, Shang-Chi was a fun time for a Marvel movie- something most comic-book flicks have forgotten about recently- and i'm excited what this character has to offer in future films.

My Rating: 8.6/10."
738,738,Shang-Chi and NOT the Ten Rings -_-,"As someone that really enjoys the MCU, I'm starting to wonder if COVID may have killed it. Black Widow was a meh experience and now Shang-Chi feels like more of that rote, by the numbers repetitiveness. Yes, they add a lot of Asian elements here to bring in other groups and try and lessen the white dominance of this franchise and I appreciate that but this movie felt like it was rushing through the plot to get to the next fantastical element and in so doing really robbed those moments of any lingering significance. Not to mention, the Marvel formula felt so very pronounced. It's so obvious what's going to happen in this movie from the jump and that's disappointing.

That aside, I'm a moderate fan of older Marvel comics and... THESE AREN'T THE TEN RINGS! Normally I don't mind when the MCU makes little adjustments to the source material. Comics are weird and a lot of that stuff wouldn't translate well to film, I get that but so far they've had two big, fat whiffs on anything Mandarin related. Looking at you Iron Man 3. These things are just super generic bands with pretty underwhelming powers which is so different from the 10 rings in the comics that all do something different!

Nerd rage aside, this just felt average to me. I'll probably check it out at some point again but I'm not feeling any sort of draw to revisit it soon. It's a touch more disappointing as I work through the Disney+ Marvel shows which all feel more engaging and more creative than this. Come on, Mouse. Get it together and put some of this TV magic back on the big screen!","As someone that really enjoys the MCU, I'm starting to wonder if COVID may have killed it.

739,739,Incredible MCU origin story,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is an incredible MCU origin story that's epic, emotional and extremely thrilling whilst also connecting to the greater universe in fun and satisfying ways. It's definitely the best thing in phase 4 so far even if it's third act has some of the usual MCU problems.

Simu Liu gives an incredible and extremely charismatic lead performance whilst also having superb chemistry with Awkwafina, who is also incredible. Michelle Yeoh and Meng'er Zhang are both great and Tony Leung is amazing as one of the better villains in the MCU with plenty of backstory and depth.

Destin Daniel Cretton's direction is excellent, it's extremely well filmed and stylish with some of the best action sequences in the franchise. The fight choreography is extremely impressive and the CG is mostly strong. It's well paced and both the soundtrack and the music by Joel P. West are both fantastic.","Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is an incredible MCU origin story that's epic, emotional and extremely thrilling whilst also connecting to the greater universe in fun and satisfying ways.

Great Pacing: Shang Chi has a lot of things built into the tale as it tries to make an origin story fit so far into the movie series. With all the information, there might be worry of the pace being off, but surprisingly it is done super well. Never really dragging, but not moving a blinding pace (mostly), Shang Chi's combination tales keeps things moving but not flying over the important elements to connect with characters. The cast gets ample time to give us their backstories, piece together all the cluse of this dynamic drama puzzle, and not sacrifice on the action to come.

Character Development: The trailers may have you thinking this is a modern martial arts film, and in a sense they would be right. However, the movie takes it one step further and goes beyond the punches to instead give the characters some soul and layers compared to the legendary films of the past. Shang's life is complicated and torn between light and dark, his sister as well experiencing the drama in her own manner that parallels the main protagonist. Even the antagonist has layers far beyond what we normally get from the Marvel group, and I loved how well their lines mixed together to make this melodramatic family story fit naturally into the Marvel universe.

The Surprise Cameo: Can't say much without spoiling, but if you are like me, then you will not be disappointed who shows up in the film. Several questions are answered with this character's return and with it many laughs to be had in the manner very familiar to Marvel fans. The inclusion of this character also holds an important (albeit stretch) plot element to give a little more meaning behind it, and I loved the choices they made to include him in the big picture.

The Cultural Influence: Like Black Panther and the African Culture, Shang Chi integrates so much of the cultural values of the Asian provinces into this movie. The costumes are stunning takes on the traditional attire, bringing the past to light while also sewing in some modern styles to jazz up the outfits. Concepts of family honor, the customs to practicing Marshal Arts, and the honoring of family are well-integrated into the story and help give the predictable tale some extra Kung Fu kick. The architecture of most of the setting breathes new life to the typical cityscapes that have been made famous in Marvel, and the legends of the Ten rings scream of the Asian mythology that is seeped int heir history. I loved how well these things were merged into a Marvel tale, and though again a little predictable and flaunting, really elevated the origin story to stand out from so many others.

The CGI Finally Disney has invested in making their movies show off what the studio can do. Shan Chi and the bunch have plenty of amazing things to overuse the computer effects that the modern era loves. Special effects for the action scenes has more realism to it then Black Widow executed, the creatures you will see have a lot more polish and fluidity to their movements, and the special effects involving the ten rings are fluid and holding depth that I felt has been missing in some recent Marvel projects.

The Acting: A great part played by all members on this film, extras included, Shang Chi's cast shows that acting is not dead and characters can be utilized well. Simu Liu as the lead was fantastic, and his campaign for being in this movie could not have ended up with better results. He holds much of the prodigal martial artist, disciplined and focused to be an avid fighter capable of crushing his enemies with his style. However, he also has that troubled layer in the past to watch that helped spread his emotional spectrum. Awkwafina is still the same cooky role she always plays, but this time gets a little more balance and heroism compared to the other characters she has heralded as in the past. I loved how well she was used in this film, and how great she complemented Simu in this role. Leung brings a lot of pizazz to the character, once again giving us an antagonist with so much more than the scowl and fist, and I felt was a perfect casting to play the opponent of Shang Chi. So many other great actors and actresses in this film, but due to time restrictions I have to move on, but trust me they did well in their performances.

The Comedy: Awkwafina is often used too much for making us laugh, and Disney has struggled with forcing a lot of comedy to make it kid friendly. However, Shang Chi has taken some steps back into discipline and used the comedy well to break up the ice. Dialogue goes a long way to breaking in the laughs, with well-timed jokes and gags being the solid punch to the gut with comedy. There are several ridiculous inclusions in this film that at first seem out of place, but then roll back in to be an extravagant joke that had great set up. And the throw in references that come with it and you get a shining beacon of awesomeness that comes with this movie. It's all done so well and I was very happy with the results.

The Action: My bread and butter for most of the Marvel movies, Shang Chi delivered very well on this film's action exposé. The art of choreographed battles brings another homage to Asian culture, and with it fantastic fights that had more bite and impressive skill use then half of the Marvel cinema. It's exciting, it's dynamic, and most of the fights have a different feel to them than what you might expect. Used well in the story, there is purpose behind the inclusion of the battles and each one has a different meaning and stakes behind it than simply punching and kicking. Even more so, the strategies behind them and what is required to win, accomplishes a level of storytelling that has been lost in the modern era, so well done on that too.

A Bit More Adult: The movie is definitely showing Marvel's modernization into the 21st century, and takes a risk of making this film darker and more adult than other installments. Cursing is definitely increased in this one, with plenty of swear words filling the dialogue, but not to the point of being overdone. No F bombs, but some of the language has got a little more bite, so caution. In addition, the tone of the tale is darker, and the sunshine and rainbows of Thor, Captain America, and Guardians is left in the dust for a grittier tale, which again is a plus.

Some of the political moments: While nowhere as bad as 75% of movies today, Shang Chi does sometimes get a bit preachy with the agenda politics of the film. Taking time out to rub it in our faces with an obvious line stating, ""Look what I had to do,"" was a bit of showboating that I could have done without. Yet even this dislike is marginal, given it's very little occurring, has some nice moments that build off of it, and sometimes has a fun lesson or joke built in.

A Little More Action:

The action in this movie is great, and I loved how much of it flowed and accomplished what I was expecting of the film, and things I was not expecting. Yet there were times where a moment of fighting felt a little forced, namely the chase scenes with vehicles that seemed like an afterthought. However, the fights at the end needed some more time for me, and perhaps a little more bouncing between the battles occurring at the same time. Star Wars has done this successfully in the past, showing all manners of battling and giving you a big scope of the battle. Shang Chi has done this better than several of the Marvel films, but still had some room to give us more looks at the other characters kicking butt. The battle is lengthy enough, I'll agree to that, but a little more showing off of the other warriors would have rounded this fight to perfection for me.

The VERDICT:

Shang Chi finally made me feel like we were back into the realm of Marvel I fell in love with years ago. A cultural building world with both origin and story continuation, this hero's quest had all the makings of a fun, exciting and swift adventure we were expecting. Buried beneath the amazing fights and special effects, was a deeper movie than I had expected, using their characters well and integrating them to serve a purpose. Balanced comedy with a cultural inclusion and politics did not steal away from the main theme of the movie, and giving it that adult touch was a plus in my book, though again caution with your little ones watching it. As for limitations, I agree there is predictability and familiarity with the movie, but the fresh twist and balance helps rejuvenate the formula and add minimize the impact of the limitations for me. Though I will say a little better wider scope battle is still needed by them. Overall, my scores for this film are:

Action/Adventure/Fantasy: 9.0-9.5 Movie Overall: 8.5-9.0.","Likes

743,743,Most Mystical and Beautiful Movie In History!,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is the most mystical and beautiful movie in history! The music, the special effects and the acting all take you to another world. The film leaves you wanting a Morris of your own.

The storyline follows a young man named Shang-Chi (Simu Liu). His father is a one thousand-year-old man and conqueror nicknamed The Mandarin (Tony Leung Chiu-wai), who has only ever used the infamous and all-powerful Ten Rings for evil. When the Mandarin is set to unleash infinite evil on the universe, Shang-Chi has to stop his father.

This movie is a cinematic experience. The fighting and choreography are out of this world. The long slow motion shots make the audience feel as if they are in a video game. Simu steals the show; every fight scene is flawless with his fluid movements and it proves just how hard he worked on his character for this film. Every audience falls in love with Shang-Chi; he's funny, with perfect comedic timing and he knows the balance between peace and violence. He encapsulates what the majority of young adults feel - like not being able to find their place in the world. The movie makes fans feel as if they've known Shang for years. It has wonderful flashbacks, which give the audience glimpses of his past, his pain and how his fears have shaped who he is. The film gives a wonderful all-around scope of this character that feels like a friend we've known all our life. It makes fans excited to see Shang-Chi again. Shang and his sister Xu Xialing are an iconic duo. They're both powerful and, while there's some tension due to their past, they put everything aside and let love shine through. Xialing is a role model, officially joining the Marvel Cinematic Universe's most powerful women. Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is perfect for AAPI (Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders) representation in cinema. It represents Chinese culture powerfully, shows what it's like to be an Asian-American in modern day USA, not to mention that Simu is Marvel Studios' first Asian-American superhero. Simu and Shang-Chi are writing history while also inspiring children and fans all around the world. The film delivers on all grounds; the cameos are shocking and leave you on the edge of your seat. Trying not to shout during the two post credits scenes prove to be a challenge. By the end of the movie, I wanted to sing the song ""Hotel California"" at the top of my lungs.

This film reminds you to search for who you are and let your past guide you to who you want to be. Ever since his mother died, Shang has been trained by his father to use violence. When he arrives at his mother's village, he learns how to find peace within himself and the world around him. He learns to trust himself and to use the rings for good.

There's a satisfying origin story here, with a few small appearances from familiar characters that add spice to a host of new characters who are all quite compelling right out of the gate.

The action's great, and there's also so much of it- I liked how lots of the action felt relatively grounded by MCU standards, with neat stunt work and exciting camerawork making the action pop (it's only the final battle that gets really CGI heavy).

The humour's also more consistent than most Marvel films, with most of the jokes landing. Also cool were all the fantasy elements and creatures- they were all pretty inventive and well-executed.

I will say the one notable flaw is that there's a lot of exposition in the film's second half, but they get around that a little by having great actors like Tony Leung and Michelle Yeoh do most of the explaining (and there is a lot to explain, with this being a whole new side of the MCU and all), so it's not super noticeable.","Thought I was feeling some Marvel fatigue after WandaVision (which started strong but ended on a bit of a whimper) and Black Widow (which wasn't terrible, but two months later I can't remember anything about it except how Florence Pugh was cool in it), but this one has rejuvenated some of my enthusiasm for the unstoppably huge MCU.

I will say the one notable flaw is that there's a lot of exposition in the film's second half, but they get around that a little by having great actors like Tony Leung and Michelle Yeoh do most of the explaining (and there is a lot to explain, with this being a whole new side of the MCU and all), so it's not super noticeable."

748,748,Perfect,"Honestly, on all levels this movie excels! The casting is perfect. The world building is creative, beautiful and faithful to its Asian roots. The CGI and location shoots are breathtaking. The fighting is the best I've ever seen and even the training ground sequences have an exquisite grace. The action was balanced by heart. I was concerned Awkwafina would take the humour to campy lows but she truly showed she has some serious dramatic chops. She was not the comic relief! They gave that honour to the Shakespearean stage giant, Ben Kingsley, Our own, homegrown 🇨🇦 Simu Liu was perfect for the part and his performance was world class. I could go on raving but I'll conclude my feedback by saying that this is in every way as powerful a MCU solo representation of Asian culture as BLACK PANTHER was for African culture. I gathered some feedback as I left the theatre, and got ratings of 7.5 (felt it needed more MCU content), 8 (saw many of the things I have just commented on). I've read the criticism that the storytelling was choppy, but I didn't find it so. For me it was more like chapters in a book, completely working together to create a world of content and design. Upon leaving the cinema, I was going to give the movie a 9 (superb) out of 10, but after reflecting on it, I don't know what they could have done to make it better, so, I give this film a 10 (perfect) out of 10. {Superhero Action Adventure}","Honestly, on all levels this movie excels!

750,750,"Could be better, still enjoyable","As a MCU fanatic, I've been trying to get excited about the movies they have released post-Endgame, but it has been a challenge. That particular film was such a perfect finale for the series that I have struggled with the efforts to get the storyline going again. It doesn't help that they have been so scattered in topics, lacking a single core group to bring them all together. Shang-Chi is another random hero that I only knew vaguely from references in the comics, but I never read any of his books back when I was a collector. I appreciated that this film brought a new style to a MCU movie. The blending of Wuxia into a superhero story was a fun choice.

There were also quite a few great actors in this film including Tony Leung, Ben Kingsley, Michelle Yeoh, and I'd even include Awkwafina in that category. I can certainly see how some other people might struggle with Awkwafina's schtick, but I find her comedic timing to be great, and I was laughing along the whole time. However, the one major name I left out of the ""great actors"" is Simu Liu. Sadly, I found him a little bland. He was okay with the comedy, but I certainly don't see him stacking up with the legends that have come before in the MCU. Heck, Benedict Wong has only about 5 minutes of screentime in this film, but still made a greater impression on me than Simu Liu.

Digging into the story of Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, I'd say it's a fine origin story, even if it was highly predictable. This is the kind of movie where you can stay 10 steps ahead of it, and that is unfortunate. I think that's the biggest problem with the entire film, while it's fun and engaging it also feels like a rough carbon copy of things that came before. It's a movie that is emulating a number of Wuxia films from the past, but it's not as good as any of them. It's a movie that is following the tropes of a superhero origin story, and once again isn't on the level of the best of the genre. You can't fault their ambition, but their execution was lacking.

All that negativity is not to say that Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is a bad film. In fact, I enjoyed the entire time in the theater, and was genuinely invested in the story. I thought it handled the links to the MCU well, but without feeling like it had shameless pandering for the fans, or devolving into obscure references only people like myself would understand. The film had some gorgeous visuals, and created its own world in a way that managed to be both unique but still consistent with the style of other MCU movies. There were personal stakes in the film, despite the fact that the ending fell into a giant CGI battle that felt unnecessary. I can't say that Shang-Chi will rise into the upper echelon of my MCU rankings, but it's better than some that came before.","As a MCU fanatic, I've been trying to get excited about the movies they have released post-Endgame, but it has been a challenge.

And now, late 2021 we can finally go back to the movies en masse, though the road to recovery's far from over.

Shang Chi is part-origin-story for a character we've never known before, part-CG-spectacle interlaced with nice kung-fu choreography in between, all in-universe expansion for Marvel's cinematic ambitions. And it makes you wonder how deeply they thought about paying reverence to everything from Bruce Lee to the Matrix, to Dragon Ball, The Last Airbender and Kung Fu Panda.

Marvel is doing its best to escape the confines of Iron Man's legacy, and this seems like an earnest start for something far-removed from the likes of Spider-Man, and so on. Also makes you wonder if Awkwafina is gonna become a major player outside the Shang Chi movies alone.

Shang Chi is the stuff you've come to expect from Marvel Studios; it's going big and it won't stop with every subsequent film here onward. Though bigger and better seems better fitted for high-concept space operas like Infinity War and Endgame than more earthbound character-driven stories.

Shang Chi's good fun, and it really succeeds in being that during its runtime.","Shang Chi is Marvel's latest blockbuster to grace the movies: and after 2020's non-existent Marvel slate, it was about bloody time we got something after the world dealt with the sars-variant and got our double shots.

753,753,Shang Chi,"Review By Kamal K

Marvels new Shang-Chi was a choreographed dance movie disguised as Kung fu with slow paced action scenes and subtle but detailed components that pull a story together a satisfying but inappropriately fast paced manner. Making the writing seem more lazy and poorly thought out, which for me took away greatly from that satisfaction.

The main gripe I have with Shang Chi is how it just so happens that the Jade neckaces show the path and time to the hidden forest path just days before another oath opens for them to go find the tao lao.

Although the comedy music, and some of the choreography for the fight scenes were good enough to give this movie a final score of 6 out of 10 score.","Review By Kamal K

This movie was very entertaining even if it had a pretty generic and predictable storyline, and special effects were fairly uneven (amazing 'MCU quality' along with pretty terrible early 2000s CGI).

758,758,A standalone ret-con of previous MCU mistakes.,"With the end of the Infinity Saga in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, there is a lot of room for new franchises to fill in the gaps left by the likes of Iron Man and Captain America. However, this means lesser-known properties like Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (2021) get their chance to shine. And while lesser-known franchises like Guardians of the Galaxy are now household names, I think it remains to be seen if Shang-Chi can truly develop its own integrated identity within the MCU.

Having somewhat botched the introduction of the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) in Iron Man 3 (2013), Shang-Chi attempts to ret-con this by insisting that the Ten Rings organization is a genuine threat to world peace. However, Marvel wants to have its cake and eat it too by including the ""Mandarin"" in this film. There are a few other loose connections to the larger MCU in this film, but they are more cameo call-outs than anything significant. Overall, Shang-Chi is its own story.

The fact that a good portion of this film's climax takes place in a mythical hidden kingdom made it feel disconnected from the MCU as a whole. Sure, other franchises within the MCU have their origin stories. Still, I felt they made it clear how they contributed to the ""whole"" of the larger arc by either introducing characters or concepts in prior MCU movies. Shang-Chi excels in its action and choreography but feels generic in the grand scheme of things as a standalone film. I'd almost wager that its sequel will be much more interesting and that those not already committed to the MCU can probably give this one a pass.

759,759,See Shang-Chi on the Big Screen,"The new Marvel Super Hero film, SHANG-CHI and the LEGEND OF THE TEN RINGS is the kind of film that deserves to be seen on the big screen and Writer/Director Destin Daniel Cretton (JUST MERCY) has crafted a film that earns that statement.

Based on the Marvel comic book character (of course), SHANG-CHI tells the tale of...well...Shang-Chi a financially struggling - but happy - Valet in San Francisco who has a family secret.

Writer/Director Cretton has crafted a whimsical, mythological, mystical and action packed film that settles in at the top end of the Marvel Cinematic Universe family of films.

At the center, newcomer Simu Liu (KIM'S CONVENIENCE) more than holds his own as the newest Super Hero in the MCU. He is grounded, centered and more sure than unsure as he discovers his abilities and his family's secrets. He is a worthy addition to this world of Superheroes.

Joining him is the remarkable Awkwafina (CRAZY, RICH ASIANS) as his best friend, sidekick who handles the drama comedy and action with aplomb. This film makes some smart choices with this character and Awkwafina shines.

The rest of the cast/characters are equally as strong from Tony Chi-Wai Leung (as Shang-Chi's father) to Meng'er Zhang (as Shang-Chi's sister) and good ol' Michelle Yeoh (as Shang-Chi's Aunt) bring strong characters to life. They all shine.

This film also brings back a character from a previous MCU film that somewhat redeems the poorly conceived character from his earlier appearance. I won't spoil it by saying who it is, but I liked what the MCU did with this character.

But, this being a Marvel movie, all of these performances anchor a bigger picture that is filled with action, action and more action - and something else, something mystical.

Here is where Director Cretton really shines. The action scenes are interestingly staged and choreographed well. The first fight (the bus fight that is shown in the trailer) and a fight on scaffolding both particularly work well.

This film does delve into the mystical in the last 1/3 and in Cretton's hands, this ends up working well instead of being comical or inane. I bought what was going on and was rooting for our heroes to defeat the undefeatable, fantastical creatures.

To be honest, the ""final battle"" didn't really live up to the rest of the film so that brings this film down a notch, but this movie did what it needed it to do, it opened up a whole new area of the Marvel Cinematic Universe - in both character and locations - and I am anxious to see where they go from here.

The Film is great if any of you are a fan of Martial Arts you are going to enjoy this also really dives into the spirituality of eastern mythos of the MCU while still have ties to the MCU Wenwu was responsible for the Ten Rings in the Iron Man films going back to the very beginning also love the father dynamic between Shang and The Mandarin great performances from Liu and Leung as well also Awkwafina continues to be on a role since Breaking out in Crazy Rich Asians and also starring in similar film in Raya And The Last Dragon This Is a Game changer also if your A Fan Forbidden Kingdom your are going love this ,This is Game Changer much like Doctor Strange in 2016. Im also grateful its helping Cinema return to form but im not against Hybrid releases though they help in certain areas also they both can Co-Exist.

West(Just Mercy) ,Cinematography by William Pope(Alita:Battle Angel) and Direction by Destin Daniel Cretton(Short Term 12) A Game Changer also its More Martial Arts Than Superhero 9/10.","Watched Shang-Chi And The Legend Of The Ten Rings with Simu Liu(Kim's Convenience) as Xu Shang-Chi/Shaun,Awkwafina(Crazy Rich Asians) as Katy ,Meng'er Zhang(The Street Dawn) as Xu Xialing,Michelle Yeoh(Crouching Tiger,Hidden Dragon) as Ying Nan, Florian Munteanu(Creed II) as Razor Fist ,Fala Chen(The Informer) as Ying Li,Benedict Wong(Avengers:Endgame) as Wong And Tony Leung(In The Mood For Love) as Wenwu/The Mandarin.

The Film is great if any of you are a fan of Martial Arts you are going to enjoy this also really dives into the spirituality of eastern mythos of the MCU while still have ties to the MCU Wenwu was responsible for the Ten Rings in the Iron Man films going back to the very beginning also love the father dynamic between Shang and The Mandarin great performances from Liu and Leung as well also Awkwafina continues to be on a role since Breaking out in Crazy Rich Asians and also starring in similar film in Raya And The Last Dragon This Is a Game changer also if your A Fan Forbidden Kingdom your are going love this ,This is Game Changer much like Doctor Strange in 2016. Im also grateful its helping Cinema return to form but im not against Hybrid releases though they help in certain areas also they both can Co-Exist.

It is a spectacle with regards to action sequence and fighting choreography, but the film misses a solid storyline for an origin story as its titular character lacks personality and does not go through any heroic transformation story arc. Simu Liu has a strong presence as Shang-Chi, yet he is overshadowed by many of his more experienced co-stars.","Destin Daniel Cretton's 'Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings' marks a bland start to the new phase of Marvel Cinematic Universe.

767,767,Ten Rings to rule them all...,"Positives:
This is Marvel at its best. A script (with Shakespearean undertones) that melds action with good character development and laugh-out-loud feelgood dialogue. The great thing is that you don't need to be a Marvel nerd to enjoy this one. Yes, there are some fabulous Easter Eggs for Marvel fans (and a wonderful return of a character from one of the early films). But its almost a standalone feature in its own right.


The action sequences are top-notch, particularly an early fight on a careering an Francisco ""bendy-bus"". Some great martial arts reminiscent of ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", made more exciting by the fact that the impressive Simu Liu did all his own stunts.






Negatives:






Timeline?: So, it took more of a Marvel nerd than I am (my wonderful daughter-in-law Bronwyn) to point out that although this film is set (largely) in the ""Present Day"", the events of ""Avengers: Endgame"" actually happen in 2023. So in the Marvel timeline, this is set in between Thanos's ""blip"" and ""the return"". This is the reason why Wong is present but not Doctor Strange, for example.

Summary Thoughts: Marvel goes East! This is a really entertaining addition to the franchise, mixing Marvel action with Eastern mysticism and martial arts. It's an impressive job by director and co-writer Destin Daniel Cretton, in only his second feature (he did ""Just Mercy"" in 2019).

As a Marvel film, there are of course end-credit scenes (""monkeys"" in onemannsmovies speak). A mid-title one is the best, bringing some additional Marvel characters into the mix. And there's a post-credits one which sets up for further sequels but which I found rather irritating.

It's ironic that a Marvel movie so right for the Chinese market - the first to be headlined by an Asian actor and with substantial Mandarin dialogue - might not get a release in China. According to this report, this appears to be for two reasons: firstly that the actor Simu Liu made some derogatory remarks about China in the past, and secondly that in the comics Shang Chi's father is Fu Manchu - a Western-derived character with racial overtones.

This doesn't seem to have hurt it so far. After less than two weeks of opening, it has made $262 million on a budget estimated to be $150-200 million.

771,771,One of the most Emotionally Charged Superhero Movies made in recent times.,"Let's keep aside all these serious conversations about Asian Representation, Diversity and all other societal stuff for a moment and let us all just appreciate Marvel for creating one of the most (if not the Most) emotionally charged superhero movies in recent times.

I'm not even exaggerating, I have been a follower of Marvel since my teenage days, suffice it to say, Through many ups and downs I keenly witnessed all of their works over the years. Trust me when I say that they have very much revamped their strategy this time around.

Excluding their typical set-up for a Comicbook blockbuster, Shang-Chi's familial/dramatic aspects are on an all-time high here. The way this story has been told, it just feels somewhat distinctive and special (Especially, compared to the last few projects Marvel has had come up with).

Other than the apparent masteries in its Audio-Visual departments (as expected); the narrative here infuses a powerful statement, a different outlook on family & self-acceptance. And guess what? It never sounded preachy nor pretentious; not for a single moment.

Another praiseworthy characteristic is the Action sequences or to be precise, all the Choreography behind! An incredible show for the Martial Arts fans and yeah FYI Simu Liu (Shang-Chi); our primary protagonist did most of his stunts, all by himself; that is amazing Isn't it?

Pretty much the same impression applies to all the other members of the ensemble; however, I do have some serious reservations about their respective character depictions.

To start with, Shang-Chi's estranged father (Played by a veteran, Tony Leung Chiu-wai); The writing on his character felt a bit detached and incoherent! Don't know about you, but for the most part, I was rather uncertain about what should I exactly feel about this guy! Should I be sympathetic or furious about the choices he had made? Gotta say this dilemma got the better of me.

Furthermore, the Mother of Shang-Chi (Played by Fala Chen) from Ta-Lo; I do feel her screentime in here should have been elongated a little bit more! Just so the viewers could grasp her part of the storyline too! Other than that, she, herself was pretty great in there. No complaints whatsoever. And Oh yeah, Nora Lum or Awkwafina (The Name, majority of you might know her by). She was terrific in her role as well; the much-needed comic relief in such a sob story!

In a nutshell, I must admit, this was a rather unprecedented gamble from Marvel and It did pay off quite well in the end. To be honest, I couldn't be more pleased about that! As I see it, these Superhero films tend to get repetitious over the years so it's always like a breath of fresh air whenever there is a drastic transition coming straight from the creators, and when it gets backed up by the Big Studios themselves; well that's your cherry on top.","Let's keep aside all these serious conversations about Asian Representation, Diversity and all other societal stuff for a moment and let us all just appreciate Marvel for creating one of the most (if not the Most) emotionally charged superhero movies in recent times.

772,772,What a pleasant surprise this was!,"Visually a perfect film for me watching a film in theatre after 20 months. Going in I expected marvel to half-ass the genre but still make it entertaining like a number of their other films. But I was taken aback wonderfully right from the beginning with the opening narration completely in Chinese. What I saw then was a proper modern wuxia fantasy which with some changes could've fooled me for a Chinese production (maybe I'm being a bit hyperbolic).

As fitting to a wuxia film, the lust for power, the love that conquers evil and the despair of lost love are all seen in this film. And who best to bring all those than the legendary Tony Leung who was the face of Hong Kong cinema through In The Mood For Love and acted in some of the best Wuxia films. He was definitely the best thing about the film. I was half expecting Marvel to mess it up like they use great actors for villains all the time. But he was the first main character to appear and even till the end his presence was felt.

This also has some of the best hand to hand action sequences in the MCU easily. The martial arts action, even when the superpowers are included also makes the action just beautiful which is something I feel the first time in an MCU film.

Awkwafina was quirky but what I liked there was that they kept it platonic and didn't jump into anything at any point. Maybe they'd do that in the future but at least they didn't break the flow in the relationship. Meng'er Zhang and Fala Chen also made their presence felt, as badass fighters. And Michelle Yeoh as expected of her came in and owned the screen when she was present.

I'm really surprised at how much I liked the film. The final fight sequences that rose to the most epic Chinese fantasy fight you can think of is the only thing I was expecting them to not mess up. Maybe it is because of my low expectations on how Marvel deals with the genre and the villain that made me love this so much.","Visually a perfect film for me watching a film in theatre after 20 months.

773,773,A Very Fresh MCU Entry,"When Iron Man hit theatres back in 2008, there were rumblings about a cinematic universe starting, but obviously, nobody expected that we would make it to a film like Avengers: Endgame at the time. Along the way, unknown properties like Guardians of the Galaxy and Ant-Man came out of nowhere as well but were welcomed with open arms. I was really hoping that Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings would follow in those footsteps, and it more than does. With rich world-building, a great cast, and the use of mythology, this is one of my favourite Marvel Cinematic Universe entries to date. Over time I may even come to appreciate it even more. After a first viewing, here's why Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings deserves to be seen on the big screen (if you can).

After being trained as an assassin by his father, Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) is given ten years of freedom from this life. In the present, the film picks up with Shang-Chi (Shaun) as he is living a normal life in San Francisco with his friend Katy (Awkwafina). When the history/mythology of the so-called Ten Rings is brought back into the forefront, his mission is to go and find his father. With the help of his friend and sister, they return home to face the music and it may just end up being father vs son to save this world. From start to finish, this film delves into the fun, the mythological, the family drama, and some incredible martial arts in order to tell this very solid story.

Aside from the fact that newcomer Simu Liu is undeniably charming and very likeable in this role, it's the unique style of the movie that made it stand out from the rest of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Yes, it still has the same look and feel, especially when it comes to aesthetics and comedic relief, but the rest of the film had its own distinct heartbeat. Bringing martial arts into this franchise just felt like a breath of fresh air to me. Not only does it feel simultaneous that they're trying to have fun and pay homage to classic films of this nature, but the fact that martial arts, mixed with actual god-like powers just felt so earned by the climax of the film. Without giving anything away, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is far more magical and mystical than I was expecting, but I kind of loved the finale when looking back on it.

There's really not much about this film that I feel compelled to complain about, but I will say that with as much drama that this film has and with how much it does dive into mythology, sometimes the comedy felt out of place. Awkwafina as Katy was great and I think her chemistry with Simu Liu was great as well, but I think certain cuts to her one-liners felt a little unnecessary for the specific situation. There are a few scenes where moments deserve our full attention, but the film felt the need to cut away to something funnier. Aside from the humour taking me out a few times, this film is just a blast.

Overall, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Tens Rings is easily at the top of the origin films that this franchise has given us and probably one of my favourite entries as a whole. Director Destin Daniel Cretton (Short Term 12, Just Mercy) has done a great job here and the cinematography by Bill Pope (The Matrix, Baby Driver) was also a real standout. I thought the scope of the movie felt very grand and that's absolutely in part to how it was filmed. I almost thought the finale of the movie was going to be a huge negative, but again, after thinking about the movie again, there is a nice progression in the story that makes the climax feel earned, even if a tad overblown. If you're a fan of this franchise, this one is a must-see, but even if you're not, this one can stand on its own as well, having only a few acknowledgements to previous films.

Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is now playing exclusively in theatres and if you're able to go in your area, I highly recommend it.","When Iron Man hit theatres back in 2008, there were rumblings about a cinematic universe starting, but obviously, nobody expected that we would make it to a film like Avengers: Endgame at the time.

774,774,Good,"One of the best origin MCU films. Good story, great and complex family relationships, with it's own identity, a very good balance between action and comedy and really good fight scenes. Between Simu Liu, Awkwafina and Tony Leung it's difficult to decide which was the best, but the acting was really strong all around (also a mention to Ben Kingsley, always funny!). The best thing I can say about it is that for most of it's duration it didn't even feel like an MCU film.

The negatives? Again, too much CGI. It's a huge problem with Marvel and Disney as they use the green screen in almost every scene. I like CGI but seriously, some scenes would look much better with practical effects, others would look way better if they just were shot at location.","One of the best origin MCU films.

""I like your spike face""... :)

Why are you punching yourself? My grandfather used to do that to me.

I'm reminded of Jackie Chan's quote... ""Chinese bamboo very strong"".

This seems sketchy.

Burn it with her in it? Nuts.

Weird horse :)

Michelle Yeoh is your relative! Cool!

So you have to dress appropriately to shoot.

Idiot hitting a ""lion"".

779,779,A miss in the MCU.,"Hollywood trying to be too woke about being Chinese.

Always hate it when they make a villain not really a villain as to not offend anyone. Shang Chi's father is supposed to be a pure villain, the mother storyline took away a lot from the real storyline.

Awkwafina's character becoming a boss archer after one day of training was equally ridiculous.

Hopefully if a sequel is made it will be darker, though I'll admit the Mandarin was a funny touch.","Hollywood trying to be too woke about being Chinese.

780,780,A Great Origin Film,"The next instalment of the MCU, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings has come out and I managed to see it the other day and I have finally found time to review it and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees a young martial artist forced to face his past when his criminal father comes hunting for him.

Main Character Relative unknown Simu Liu plays Shang-Chi and he is really good in this role. He really delivers a strong performance and you will come out of the film really liking him and caring about the character of Shang-Chi. The focus on his family dynamic is really well done and Liu does a great job in selling that and showing the pain that he has been through in his life and bringing this great hero to life. He is also fantastic in the action scenes and that is a huge part of this film and you have to believe in the heroes capabilities and I really did.

Supporting Characters Awkwafina plays his best friend Katy and I feel like this character is really going to split opinion, some will hate her, some will love her. I pretty much hit both ends of the spectrum, I thought she was really annoying in the first act of the film and it hurt my enjoyment, but as she had her role slightly lessened she became much more likeable and her character arc became very clear. Tony Leung plays his first role in an American film playing Wenwu and this is one of the best antagonists in the current MCU. I loved this character and performance, he isn't just some generic bad guy and at times I really understood his motivations and saw the emotion from his performance and it was really strong. Meng'er Zhang plays Xialing and I liked her character here and I thought it really complemented Shang-Chi really well. There is clearly issues there and the film plays it up well, and makes her more then just this female sidekick and she is given a personality.

Story The story is at its strongest when it focuses on the family issues between the characters, in particular Shang-Chi and Wenwu. That father and son dynamic is great and both actors deliver really well in their roles and it makes there clashes feel even more important as you genuinely care about both of them in the film. The issue is that the film kind of strays away from that and tries to focus on too much. It has plenty of exposition scenes and fits so much in that it distracts from the main thing that makes this film great. The final act puts the focus in the wrong place, its hard to explain without spoilers but I think you will know what I mean if you watch the film.

Script The script is okay, the drama is really well done and made me care about these characters and the emotional predicaments that they are put in during this adventure and I actually think this film is held back a little bit by the fact that it is in the MCU. What I mean by that is that it has the humour you come to expect from the universe is here but it is done poorly and I never really laughed at all and that was a disappointment.

Style The film looks fantastic, the CGI is all beautiful and I think it does an excellent job of building this world of Martial arts that is very different to other elements of the MCU. The fight scenes live up to the hype and are the best that have been seen in The Marvel Cinematic Universe, the flow so well and are so hard hitting that it is easily the best element of the film.

Overall Overall, Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings is a great film and another solid addition to The Marvel Cinematic Universe. It isn't top tier Marvel but does a great job of introducing a new hero in Shang-Chi.

Rating - 8/10.","The next instalment of the MCU, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings has come out and I managed to see it the other day and I have finally found time to review it and here is my review for it.

781,781,A wonderful addition to the MCU!,"Shang-Chi is one of those Marvel films that feels like the full package. It has lots of brilliant trademark MCU humour and tongue in cheek quips. It has exceptional action which I'll get into a bit more. It also has solid connections to the rest of the MCU, balanced well between being its own stand alone film but laying hints of how this is going to fit into the wider story of Phase 4.

I'll start with the action as this is what Shang-Chi is famed for. Quite simply it's awesome. It has the best hand to hand combat the MCU has seen, and sequences that are steeped in Chinese culture, with the rhythmic style of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon woven into the fabric of this film.

The cast was brilliant. Simu Liu was a fantastic lead, and I'd be happy to see him grow into a big player in the MCU. Awkwafina as expected was fantastic, adding so much effortless humour to the film.

What I really love about Shang-Chi is that it has a very well explored and interesting antagonist. This can't always be said for Marvel films as there have been a few phoned in villains, but Shang-Chi doesn't come close to falling into this trap. Tony Leung really sold his role and gave it a lot of power and emotion.

In terms of plot they did a fantastic job of introducing us to this pretty obscure character. There is a lot of exposition and plenty of flashbacks, perhaps too many but I appreciate they had a lot of background content to feed us so I can't grumble too much. I loved how the plot was so mystical and magical, very much feeling like an epic adventure.

Yet again Marvel Studios knocking it out of the park!","Shang-Chi is one of those Marvel films that feels like the full package.

782,782,nothing out of this world but a lot better then i expected,,
783,783,Showcases the possibilities of Phase 4,"This was the right direction for Marvel to head post-Endgame. Finding new stories to tell within cultures rarely explored is the way for the MCU to continue to entertain.

The fights in the first third of this movie were absolutely brutal and quite innovative. I wish they hadn't front-loaded all of this stunning choreography since the fights later on paled in comparison. This film also contains arguably the most beautiful and artful scene in the MCU with the Crouching Tiger-inspired hidden garden duel. There was a sense of more indie-based filmmaking and I really enjoyed that fresh take on the genre. I would be remiss not to mention Tony Leung, who perfectly brings to life one of the finest villains in the MCU. His character has a lot of depth and is one you can truly empathize with.

While there are still the tropes expected in a Marvel origin film, it succeeds pretty well for the most part. I wish the big CGI battle at the end had just been a personal fight between father and son, but alas. The humor, especially Awkwafina, was pretty hit or miss as well. The Trevor Slattery stuff was great though.

Shang-Chi is definitely one of the best origin films in the MCU and really stands out as a unique entry in the long-running series.","This was the right direction for Marvel to head post-Endgame.

784,784,Really good blend of martial arts and MCU formula,"The bus fight scene is one of the best action scenes of the entire MCU. Just for that scene alone, this movie deserves to be watched on the biggest screen possible. Shang Chi benefited from being a very unknown character and the movie gives him the opportunity to shine bright with his development. The story is really fast paced and even if the final act succumbs to the typical Marvel esque, it leaves you with a pretty solid good feeling while leaving the cinema. A really great MCU movie, a superb martial arts spectacle and a great step up for the Phase 4. Do not miss the two post credits scenes. The middle scene is exciting and the very last one is pretty intriguing. Bring it on, Marvel!","The bus fight scene is one of the best action scenes of the entire MCU.

785,785,The birth of a new legend,"The birth of a new Marvel Hero. And a very successful one. One of the better Marvel adaptations of the recent years and the perfect introduction of this new hero.

Its packed with amazing action, a great legacy and a wisely picked cast who get the chance to portray fun characters.

To start with Simu Liu who shoots himself to stardom with this film. His portrayal was fun as he perfectly mixes the hero attitude with a nice tongue-in-cheek humor and perfectly develops himself without taking all of it too seriously. Same goes to his co-star Awkwafina who was perfectly cast. Having Tony Leung as the to center-part was an excellent creative decision. Then the film has some fan favorites appearing as Ben Kingsley's Trevor or Benedict Wong who round it up to a wonderful Marvel adventure, just as you would expect.

The action scenes are tremendous, as the film is filled with great Martial Arts sequences, (of course Michelle Yeoh is not to be missed here). The bus scene at the beginning is a true stand out action scene in the entire Marvel universe.

Really a good one for the next phase of Marvel, and I like how it links to the whole universe just perfectly. Another Marvel winner.","The birth of a new Marvel Hero. And a very successful one. One of the better Marvel adaptations of the recent years and the perfect introduction of this new hero.

786,786,Elevates itself above the typical superhero origin story by incorporating many fantastic elements from Asian culture,"""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" is the second film in Phase Four of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Starring Simu Liu, Tony Leung, and Awkwafina, it elevates itself above the typical superhero origin story by incorporating many fantastic elements from Asian culture.

In San Francisco, Shaun (Simu Liu) works as a parking valet along with his close friend Katy (Awkwafina). Unbeknownst to Katy, Shaun is hiding important secrets from her - he is in fact a skilled martial artist whose real name is Shang-Chi and he has run away from his father Xu Wenwu (Tony Leung), the leader of the powerful Ten Rings organisation. After some Ten Rings members attack the pair of them on a bus, Shang-Chi discovers that they have stolen a valuable pendant given to him by his mother Li (Fala Chen) before he left for the United States. Shang-Chi grows concerned that the Ten Rings' next target will be the pendant belonging to his younger sister Xialing (Meng'er Zhang), and so along with Katy he sets off to look for her before the gang can locate her first.

Now that the Infinity Saga has concluded, the time has come for some new heroes to enter the MCU. Of course, there are so many to choose from, considering the large roster of characters that have come into existence over the last several decades. Although Shang-Chi wasn't the first one to come to my mind when predicting who would lead the charge of fresh faces into Phase Four, his debut big screen outing ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" successfully cements him as a memorable hero just as worthy as any other past Avenger.

What I believe separates this film from the typical hero origin story is all of the interesting aspects of Asian culture it integrates into the story. I'm all for inclusivity in movies, so long as it isn't shoehorned in there for the sake of appeasing a political agenda, and here it succeeds greatly thanks to the wide array of Asian crew members who worked hard to ensure that virtually all customs are represented. The film never precisely establishes the place Shang-Chi's family is from (though it is hinted to be somewhere in mainland China), as they are seen observing various cultural traditions that don't quite narrow things down to one particular Asian country. For example, there are martial artists resembling Shaolin monks, who are supposed to be from China, seen using techniques from Japanese and Korean folklore. This has likely been done on purpose to ensure that all Asian audiences feel included, but never so much that it comes across as disrespectful. After previously bungling Asian-related matters with the terrible 2020 remake of ""Mulan"", ""Shang-Chi"" feels like an appropriate apology from Disney to all of their viewers.

At this stage, it feels pointless to complain about Marvel films following the exact same template when introducing new heroes so I won't hold that against this one too much. With that said, thanks to some brilliantly choreographed martial arts fight scenes and gorgeous visuals, director Destin Daniel Cretton (""Just Mercy"") has provided us with one of the most unique looking MCU films to date. One scene near the beginning features Xu Wenwu walking through a bright, beautiful oriental garden complete with bamboo reeds in the foreground. A short time later, he is locked in hand-to-hand combat with his future love interest Li. This reminded me of ""wuxia"" films, a popular subgenre of Chinese martial arts movies, like ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"". In fact, this scene was such a good tribute to that genre that I almost forgot this was a Marvel movie and was instead watching one of those classic Kung Fu films my dad used to show me when I was young. You know you've created something special when your film can appeal this effectively to fans of both Marvel and Kung Fu movies.

Considering the last thing I saw him in was the sitcom ""Kim's Convenience"", Simu Liu definitely took me by surprise as to how well cast he was as the film's main star. I was expecting him to be a wisecracking Americanised version of the Asian hero but he actually plays most of the film straight, only responding humorously when absolutely necessary. His dramatic side truly shines when he is interacting with his onscreen father Tony Leung. In fact, Leung's character Xu has one of the most tragic backstories of any character in the whole MCU, which I won't spoil here. Another surprise was Awkwafina as Shang-Chi's best friend Katy. Rather than being another typical love interest, Katy is instead a loyal platonic friend of his who is willing to help him out no matter how limited her knowledge on the field of battle may be. It also helps that she is responsible for most of the film's comic relief.

With a new superhero now officially introduced, it's safe to assume that ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" has shown an optimistic future for the MCU. Its broad appeal to Eastern and Western audiences alike as well as the usual action-packed fun we've come to expect over the years makes it one of the best origin films to come out of the MCU to date. The Marvel hype train shows no signs of slowing down and if things keep going the way they are, it won't be stopping anytime soon.

Special effects: average. Characterization: average. Plot twists: average. I still enjoyed myself, and still appreciated Marvel transforming an exploitative property into something culturally rich.

789,789,"It's very pretty, but the story/plot is mediocre and filled with holes","As far as visuals go, this movie is amazing... like just about as impressive as Dune, it's filled to the brim with eye-candy.

The plot/story however is mediocre and filled with plot holes... the characters' actions are often unrealistic and they will often just 'stare in awe' at their friends being killed, instead of doing the realistic thing, and immediately defending their friends... it's something that happens like 5 times and honestly spoils the movie for me.... if characters in a movie don't act or react realistically and stare at something like a braindead zombie (like their friends getting killed right in front of them, whilst they are holding a gun in their freeking hands), then it's just really terrible script/plot writing.

Overall, the movie isn't as bad as Ant-Man 2 but it's not far behind. Also, Awkwafina's acting style was already old by the 2nd movie she did... ALL of her characters in movies are the same person, and like I said, it got boring after the 2nd movie. I roll my eyes at everything Awkwafina's character does in the movie.

It's a 5/10 movie, not really worth a watch unless you're a real die-hard Marvel fan.","As far as visuals go, this movie is amazing... like just about as impressive as Dune, it's filled to the brim with eye-candy.

790,790,There's Dragon Fights!,"What more do you want?

I honestly didn't want to like this film. As you may have read in previous reviews of the Marvel films, they are all dumb. And this one ends as they all do, with just massive CGI chaos. But did I mention they were dragons fighting?

Anyway, the film is fun. Fun and lively in the sense of watching a water painting come to life. The fight sequences are laborious...sometimes. Since being rocked with energy source that could topple buildings doesn't even crack a rib seems silly.

But Shang-Chi makes it work. Here played by the moon-faced wide-eyed and fun loving Simu Liu. And he does a wonderful job NOT wanting to be anything but a typical slacker. While he carries the burden of a darker past..haunted, even...he does his best to make the best of his situation with his San Fran pal Katy. Now usually Awkwafina irritates me to no end. Here, she is much more subdued and is truly a ""bro"" any guy would want in a sisterly form/love interest. The balance of her hip banter to seriousness is flawless. And quite the joy when not on screen.

Big kudos to Tony Leung. Who has spent generations emoting with the most efficient use of words. He doesn't require much and carries a lot. He plays a former evil doer whose only motivation is love.

His fatherly love for his children is only surpassed by regaining a love he's lost. And truly embodies that person who cannot let it go. But that credit goes to Li, played by Fala Chen. A gentle soul in what can be described as Shangri-La. I could watch her do kata for hours. Her gracefulness would make any man want to open the gates of Hell for.

Much praise goes to director Destin Cretton for balancing spirituality with family ties. This is a very difficult line to tow while trying not to be overbearing. He was smart enough to know that the family dynamics of an Asian household have small passive-aggressive moments that pick at the main characters. But doesn't ever go past the ""you must have honor"" trope that infects a movie like ""Mulan""","What more do you want?

But somehow somewhere it felt like the film was actually made for kids maybe because of the story being wholly dependent on the magical dragon.

Also, there could've been some heavy emotions & more action sequences & some twists/turns in the script to have more grip on the audience. Overall, it was a good watch but could've been still better.","Cool worlds/ten-rings VFX, OKayish plot, good characterisations.

792,792,An Asian Marvel Origin story with all the spectacle you've come to expect.,"Another great and entertaining experience which is very similar to what has gone before in format, but the formula works very well and I enjoyed the film a lot. The Asian style and presentation is beautiful, showing off plenty of folklore and style in both modern and traditional settings. The presentation is very stylish, the special effects were superb and the martial arts fight scenes were fast and exciting The plot is good, focusing on the human and family side of the characters rather than the magical, and sets up a good intrigue for the continuation of the MCU. The acting is good and although the comic relief and cute character did change things up, they also spoiled it a bit and made the slow middle section drag on even more. The ending was pretty grand and epic, but I felt it could have been better.","Another great and entertaining experience which is very similar to what has gone before in format, but the formula works very well and I enjoyed the film a lot.

794,794,Unique. But a very fun film,"I have to say I was looking forward to this one. First film in a while that had no connection to avengers etc so I was intrigued to see how they would do this. And on the whole it was very enjoyable and fun to watch!

First instincts when watching were a little mixed. It was an odd start to say the least and didn't have any idea how this was going to go. And my first instincts on Katy were also mixed. I felt like they were trying to force the humour out on her and I found her character really annoying. HOWEVER..

Once it gets going the film gets better and better. Katy becomes a great character and all the characters development and arcs on a whole were truly phenomenal! For me the best part of the film was the characters and seeing them all develop throughout.

So is the plot good? To be blunt, yes! It's truly unique and uniquely done in so many ways, I don't want to give out anything that would spoil anything, but it's really not what you expect. That's all I say!



I'll shut up now! I'll just say it's well worth watching. It's a great ""superhero"" to have and a great one to watch. And overall it's a fun, visually pleasing and brilliant watch. I recommend.","I have to say I was looking forward to this one. First film in a while that had no connection to avengers etc so I was intrigued to see how they would do this.

797,797,Really enjoyable film 7/10,"Shang - Chi is the new hero of the MCU and everyone is going to love him. Although I have a really deep criticism over fase 4 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I've decided to go watch the movie in theaters (after two years of being away from theaters due to covid). Overall I really enjoyed it. There were still a few moments that I regretted and that were dull. Not to mention ""little mistakes"" that Marvel keep doing with their movies. In general it was a fun experience. The plot didn't have much to offer to be honest: another origin story of a superhero that tries to run away from his fate and responsibilities. Until he is forced to face his past.

This has been the kind of way for Marvel to introduce their new characters in the MCU, I wished they would have been more creative but they do deliver creativity for once. Watching people speak their native language for once was a huge step up for Marvel. The movie is also influenced by many other asian classic films such as ""Hero"", ""Hidden Dragon"", ""Seven Samurai"" and ""In the mood for love"".

Of course it wouldn't be a Marvel movie without some end credits scenes (how original). The end credit scene does confirm the return of Shang Chi at some point, but what the end credits scene does confirm moreover is how the future Marvel films will all get connected. As I said before, I'm less optimistic with this whole fase 4 of Marvel but it wouldn't hurt or kill to watch a few of them. To me, I just wanted to return to the theaters.

Speaking of actors: Simu Liu is a fantastic actor and will definitely become a fan favorite, both him and his character. Awkwafina steals the show every single time she's on screen. Tony Leung is wonderful and acts so well. The whole cast is perfect. If you are in favor of theaters and Marvel movies than go watch Shang Chi.

P. S: the end credit song - Fire in the Sky by Anderson Paak. Is the best part of the movie.","Shang - Chi is the new hero of the MCU and everyone is going to love him.

801,801,Awesome.,"Best fight scenes since the civil war airport scene. They mess up simply by trying to make the character 10 years younger then the actor is.

Great addition to MCU , especially after the quality level the shows have been.","Best fight scenes since the civil war airport scene.

803,803,Refreshing and Captivating!,"""I gave you ten years to live your life. And where did that get you? You walked in my shadow.""

Marvel Studios' Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings follows Shang-Chi, a seemingly ordinary young man from San Francisco who parks cars for a living alongside his friend, as must confront the past he thought he left behind when he is drawn into the web of the mysterious Ten Rings organization. Marvel took a big chance on this project. Of course we've had lesser known heroes end up getting their own movie franchise within the MCU, but Shang-Chi is not one many know about. Little was known going in other than we'd get some action scenes and explore new territory within the MCU. What they managed to do with Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings is unlike any Marvel movie yet. Destin Daniel Cretton takes a new approach that works wonders. His previous works of Short Term 12 and Just Mercy are heartfelt dramas so something big like this is new territory, but he incorporates the same style and messages into this. The dysfunctional family dynamic serving as the character arc and forming the conflict is so much deeper than some random business guy who wants to rule the world. With this story, it's easy to connect with it and understand character motives. I will say there's a lot to pack in here and the story can get muddy at points, but it pulls itself together that we retain most of everything.

Simu Liu is fantastic in the title role. Previous to watching, I hadn't seen him in anything. But he has all the skills as an emerging actor to be a household name. Shang-Chi is an interesting character to follow. As he discovers and recalls moments from his upbringing, we can slowly piece him together. There's much more to be made from him, but with future installments we'll be able to get much more. And Tony Chiu-Wai Leung is perfectly cast as Xu Wenwu. He's a villain I can understand, like, and dislike all at the same time. He's flawed, but there's depth to him. And he almost steals the show by the end with another showcase of mad acting skills. But the character I've been thinking of a lot, and mainly because she was so hilarious, is Awkwafina as Katy. Awkwafina is one of my favorite actresses working right now, especially after her role in The Farewell, and she smashes this. Katy is the typical comedic sidekick but so much fun. One of the funniest jokes comes from her and I was laughing hysterically. Maybe more character will come from her later, but what we got was enough for me. I can't wait to see her again! I should also mention Meng'er Zhang as Xialing. This is her first role and she's also great. What they'll do with her next should be interesting.

From a technical standpoint, this is impressive for a Marvel movie. There are some stunning visuals. The cinematography isn't that gray color scheme used in most, though it does fall into that later on, and bursting with color. And as you probably know, the visual effects are as good as they come. It's not muddled with CGI and a scene that was completely green screen, which is nice to see. Also, Marvel has been doing great with the themes and score lately because this is another great one, along with the soundtrack. Paired with this are the best fight scenes out of the whole MCU. The stunt choreography is top notch and is beautiful and intense to look at. The bus scene early on is the best yet and will be hard to top! Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings just really did it for me and most everybody can agree. It's refreshing and captivating in every way. Marvel has been taking some big leaps with this new phase and it gets me more and more excited for each new installment!","""I gave you ten years to live your life. And where did that get you?

807,807,Shang-Chi and the legend of The Ten Rings - enjoyably unMarvellous film. 80%,"""Shang-Chi and the legend of The Ten Rings"" is a superhero origin story which seems more like a Chinese martial arts film than the next entrant in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Many years ago I saw ""Crouching tiger, hidden dragon"" and found the fight scenes in that literally unbelievable a lot of the time. ""Shang-Chi"" often seems subtle in its fight scenes by comparison but then does have action sequences which are more like MCU superhero films. As an origin story, it assumes no familiarity with the MCU and in fact plays mostly as a non-MCU film, which is what I liked about it.

Simu Liu plays Shang-Chi/Shaun, the son of a mobster, Xu Wenwu (played by Tony Leung) who could quite easily have been the subject of a film or franchise himself, due to his legendary characteristics. Shang-Chi's mother Ying Li (played by Fala Chen) is also a legendary kind of character. This contrast of 'Eastern' legendary figures and 'Western' MCU legendary figures worked to the former's advantage, as the latter often come across as plastic toy figurines being used in a sandpit by small boys to play with.

The plot concerns how Shang-Chi/Shaun sought to move from under the shadow of his father to become his own man but just when he thought he was out, he is pulled back into Wenwu's orbit. The film mixes the seriousness, perhaps, of Chinese martial arts films with the jokey style of American Hollywood films. As should be expected from a MCU film, eventually the fate of the world will come into play and someone will have to play the hero to save it.

The martial arts in this film juxtaposes frenetic fight sequences with elegant and fluid fight scenes which have their own particular charm. Other times the action sequences seem lifted from a Disney live action family film and that was enjoyable too, if you just suspended disbelief.

Speaking of comedy, I found the earliest instance of this to be aiming very low for laughs, which isn't uncommon in MCU films but I warmed to later instances of it. For instance, I was amused by the character of a thespian who sounded like he was from Liverpool, when he reminisced about what he took from a film that he saw as a teenager and how that inspired him to get into acting. That actor playing the thespian did seem familiar, perhaps for his voice but I did recognise his name in the closing credits and remembered the role that he is perhaps best known for.

An interesting aspect to this film is its subject matter, i.e. An Asian superhero and a mostly Asian cast. Is this another attempt by Hollywood to crack the now important Chinese market? If it is, then the cooling relations between the US and China is an unwelcome fly in the ointment for Hollywood studios trying to make a lot of money from Chinese cinemagoers.

Another question that came into my mind was whether ""The Ten Rings"" is based on Chinese legend or is a Marvel appropriation of Chinese culture, tailored for 'Western' audiences that don't care about cultural authenticity. If it isn't the former, then I think that there could be a niche for films which mine authentic 'Eastern' legends and myths. That could be something which might interest me (Sinophiles would no doubt reel out a long list of films which have done just that!).

As you might have guessed, I wasn't the first in line to see this film. In fact, I wasn't even sure that I wanted to see it, as I haven't watched every line of superhero films in the MCU (maybe I should watch ""The Black Panther""?). As it stands, I think it was worth the punt in seeing it. I'd go so far as to say that seeing a sequel to this would be more appealing if it wasn't tied to The Avengers franchise! Furthermore, I would have liked this film not to remind that it was part of the MCU, which it managed to do, at least until the closing credits, which I didn't welcome when it made its first appearance. With that being said, this is the kind of film that you could watch again, after a suitable break. Although I didn't watch this film in 3D, it might be worth it to do so (as sometimes the extra cost of the ticket gives added value to the experience and...sometimes it doesn't).

Notes to self:

* The narrative did have some logical gaps in it, for example why Shang-Chi was attacked on the bus. What was that all about?

* The film was dedicated to the memory of Brad Allan, I think. Not sure who that was...searching now, a few websites list him as the supervising stunt coordinator.

* Reading the closing credits, I was reminded that this film was shot in Australia, which isn't obvious watching it, so, good job studio (I think I saw or heard something on ABC in Australia about how Asian Australians got to be in this film, perhaps a kung fu exponent or exponents)!

* My score for this film was tracking from 75% (7 out of 10 stars) to 75+% (8 out 10 stars) to just a flat 80% final score.","""Shang-Chi and the legend of The Ten Rings"" is a superhero origin story which seems more like a Chinese martial arts film than the next entrant in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU).

Simu Liu plays Shang-Chi/Shaun, the son of a mobster, Xu Wenwu (played by Tony Leung) who could quite easily have been the subject of a film or franchise himself, due to his legendary characteristics. Shang-Chi's mother Ying Li (played by Fala Chen) is also a legendary kind of character. This contrast of 'Eastern' legendary figures and 'Western' MCU legendary figures worked to the former's advantage, as the latter often come across as plastic toy figurines being used in a sandpit by small boys to play with.

The plot concerns how Shang-Chi/Shaun sought to move from under the shadow of his father to become his own man but just when he thought he was out, he is pulled back into Wenwu's orbit. The film mixes the seriousness, perhaps, of Chinese martial arts films with the jokey style of American Hollywood films. As should be expected from a MCU film, eventually the fate of the world will come into play and someone will have to play the hero to save it.

The martial arts in this film juxtaposes frenetic fight sequences with elegant and fluid fight scenes which have their own particular charm. Other times the action sequences seem lifted from a Disney live action family film and that was enjoyable too, if you just suspended disbelief.

Speaking of comedy, I found the earliest instance of this to be aiming very low for laughs, which isn't uncommon in MCU films but I warmed to later instances of it. For instance, I was amused by the character of a thespian who sounded like he was from Liverpool, when he reminisced about what he took from a film that he saw as a teenager and how that inspired him to get into acting. That actor playing the thespian did seem familiar, perhaps for his voice but I did recognise his name in the closing credits and remembered the role that he is perhaps best known for.

An interesting aspect to this film is its subject matter, i.e. An Asian superhero and a mostly Asian cast. Is this another attempt by Hollywood to crack the now important Chinese market? If it is, then the cooling relations between the US and China is an unwelcome fly in the ointment for Hollywood studios trying to make a lot of money from Chinese cinemagoers.

Another question that came into my mind was whether ""The Ten Rings"" is based on Chinese legend or is a Marvel appropriation of Chinese culture, tailored for 'Western' audiences that don't care about cultural authenticity. If it isn't the former, then I think that there could be a niche for films which mine authentic 'Eastern' legends and myths. That could be something which might interest me (Sinophiles would no doubt reel out a long list of films which have done just that!).

As you might have guessed, I wasn't the first in line to see this film. In fact, I wasn't even sure that I wanted to see it, as I haven't watched every line of superhero films in the MCU (maybe I should watch ""The Black Panther""?). As it stands, I think it was worth the punt in seeing it. I'd go so far as to say that seeing a sequel to this would be more appealing if it wasn't tied to The Avengers franchise! Furthermore, I would have liked this film not to remind that it was part of the MCU, which it managed to do, at least until the closing credits, which I didn't welcome when it made its first appearance. With that being said, this is the kind of film that you could watch again, after a suitable break. Although I didn't watch this film in 3D, it might be worth it to do so (as sometimes the extra cost of the ticket gives added value to the experience and...sometimes it doesn't).

Notes to self:

* The narrative did have some logical gaps in it, for example why Shang-Chi was attacked on the bus. What was that all about?

* The film was dedicated to the memory of Brad Allan, I think. Not sure who that was...searching now, a few websites list him as the supervising stunt coordinator.

* Reading the closing credits, I was reminded that this film was shot in Australia, which isn't obvious watching it, so, good job studio (I think I saw or heard something on ABC in Australia about how Asian Australians got to be in this film, perhaps a kung fu exponent or exponents)!

* My score for this film was tracking from 75% (7 out of 10 stars) to 75+% (8 out 10 stars) to just a flat 80% final score."
808,808,Phase Four is in Full Swing!,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings far surpassed any expectations I had. It's easily the best Marvel movie post-Infinity Saga (I know, that's not exactly saying much), and is very promising for the quality of Marvel's next projects. We have probably the second best villain intimately tied to the origin of a new, entertaining, and capable hero full of potential, in a story that ties the universe together and teases upcoming events in tantalising and unexpected ways. The fight choreography was on point, the dialogue was seeped in cultural significance, the jokes all land, and the CGI is some of the best since Thanos himself. Shang-Chi is an all-out success for Marvel, it seems in multiple ways - both critically and financially. Really its only downfall is that at times this doesn't feel like that much of a movie about Shang-Chi himself purely because his origin is tied so closely to the story of the Ten Rings. Instead it's a Ten Rings movie featuring Shang-Chi, which is fine, but feels a bit weird for his introduction into the MCU. And yes, the Ten Rings are tied up with the Iron Man films perfectly, almost making the whole Aldrich Killian thing better in retrospect. I give Shang-Chi a high 8/10, with promise of moving up with rewatches.","Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings far surpassed any expectations I had.

809,809,Feast for the eyes...,"I can't decide whether I loved this movie because it's great or if it's just the best cinematography Bill Pope's done since The Wachowski's ""The Matrix"" trilogy?

Either way, ""Shang-Chi"" is easily the most visually distinctive & stunning film in the MCU thus far - vibrant, kinetic, gorgeously framed / composed, with its own individualistic sense of personality - & the symbiosis between the fight choreography & camera work supercedes that of any previous installment in the Marvel franchise - resulting in an incredible style that works effortlessly throughout... I can't stress this enough - some moments are honestly breathtaking (my jaw was on the floor) & it's an utter joy to see such expertly constructed & perfectly timed sequences - of pure, unapologetic cinema - unfold. Allows the audience the uncommon opportunity to just sit back & relax whilst watching, safe in the knowledge those responsible for bringing the screenplay to life are trustworthy, capable hands. Hence, the creator's dependability reassures viewers that they can simply focus on enjoying the experience instead, making it even more fun.

Although I shouldn't be surprised everything's captured so masterfully - considering the reliably quirky inventiveness of the visionary director of photography at the helm of the project - despite his legendary status, I still wasn't expecting a solo film (made by such an infamously corporate production company which normally shuns creative experimentation of any kind, churning out unadventurous, generic, copy + paste origin stories) to be so shockingly well realised on screen, it would consequently make ""Avengers: Endgame"" look embarrassingly trivial & unengaging by comparison... Yet somehow, under the watchful eye of director Destin Daniel Cretton, together, this duo manage to accomplish exactly that successfully, capturing scenes with a unique confidence I rarely (if ever) see in recent comic book adaptations.

For instance, usually, I can't stand the bland, dull, grey, lifeless aesthetics of Disney movies (renowned for their very ugly colour grading & over reliance on CGI) but the filmmaking here feels as uncharacteristically bold, audacious, awe inspiring, original, immersive & as epic as James Wan's ""Aquaman"" or James Cameron's ""Avatar"", utilising VFX effectively to enhance the scale of the tale being told, rather than detract from the overall plot. Of course, technically impressive world building & enormous scale / grandiosity are meaningless qualities & hollow attributes to possess if the narrative lacks depth or engaging characters but thankfully, this offers just enough heart to additionally feel emotionally investable, as well as spectacular.

Wish I could've seen this in the theatre.","I can't decide whether I loved this movie because it's great or if it's just the best cinematography Bill Pope's done since The Wachowski's ""The Matrix"" trilogy?

815,815,Surprisingly good.,"I have to say that this was a surprisingly good movie. I say surprisingly because Marvel (or DC for that matter) have not exactly excelled in making even decent movies for quite some time. That the woke ""critics"" on Rotten Tomatoes gave it high ratings was a bit of a red flag as well but not only was the movie rather free from woke ramblings and preaching but it was a very fun and entertaining movie to watch.

The movie starts off in a somewhat bizarre way with Shang-Chi and his girlfriend swiping a car from a valet parking and going for a joy ride. It turns out that they are telling their story to a couple of friends and that is pretty much how this movie is told.

It begins more or less right away with some nice action and it continues that away with plenty of action sequences intermixed with story telling. The action and martial arts is really good in my opinion. They are in stark contrast to the mediocre rubbish we were treated to in Snake Eyes. The latter which was quite a disappointment.

This movie relies heavily on fantasy elements with tie ins to Doctor Strange, especially towards the end. Another movie that I liked a lot by the way. Thus there are of course plenty of special effects and CGI. Most of them good or very good. I really liked the beautiful world of Ta Lo. The combat scenes, especially when the rings are in action are both cool and beautiful.

There are quite a lot of comical relief in the movie as well and, for once, it is not to silly, outrageous or plain stupid. It contributes well to the enjoyment factor of the movie. The washed out actor is a bit on the limit but otherwise it works well with the rest of the movie. That guy on the bus starting to film and make commentaries was quite hilarious for instance.

The story? Well it is a Marvel special effects movie so one should not expect too much but the story is not bad. It mostly holds together and works well enough to tie all the action together. The acting is pretty much the same thing. One should not expect too much but it is good enough. It was nice to see Michelle Yeoh as Ying Nan though. She was one of the few cool characters in Discovery and she does know how to act.

Overall I very much enjoyed this movie. It is a simple super hero and fantasy adventure story with lots of action and special effects and with the single purpose of entertaining the audience that doesn't fall in the trap of trying to ""educate"" said audience.","I have to say that this was a surprisingly good movie.

816,816,Surprisingly entertaining for MCU's 4th phase,"Now that we're finally into the fourth phase of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, we're getting to see the deep cuts from everyone's favorite superhero community. Despite having an unnecessarily long title, 'Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings' is a fun ride that doesn't feel like a retread of Marvel films past.

The introduction to Shaun (Shang-Chi, portrayed by Simu Liu) is handled well, as the character is likable and feels like a good fit among the established members of S. H. I. E. L. D. Comic relief comes in the form of Awkwafina's Katy - sidekick to Shaun - and an atypical showing by Sir Ben Kingsley, while more serious performances are delivered by veteran actors Tony Chiu-Wai Leung and Michelle Yeoh.

As for the plot, it can almost be split in two, as the first and second halves of 'Shang-Chi' feel like completely different films. The first half is very unserious and comes off as a companion to the latest 'Spider-man' entries, whereas the second half is a more traditional Marvel action-drama. Even though there are plenty of typical superhero tropes thrown in here with even more of a Disney imprint than past MCU movies, it's still enjoyable for what it is.

The somewhat surprising strength of 'Shang-Chi' suggests there's no slowing down in the MCU film factory.","Now that we're finally into the fourth phase of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, we're getting to see the deep cuts from everyone's favorite superhero community.

817,817,Sort of disappointed..,"I got to admit I wasn't particularly blown away by anything in the movie.. I might even say ""I was bored"" by it.

Don't get me wrong.. it IS a spectacle! The action is great. The locations are nice, costume design, sound design, etc. But it is overall a soft release not worth seeing in theaters.. specially as a follow-up to what Endgame was.

The biggest problem for me, is how the underwritten lead has muddled personality (for reasons covered in the story) devoid of charm, personality or good dialogue.

The next issue is the humor, which didn't land for me.. Not once. The supporting lead Awkwafina isn't her normal ""loud"" self that's supposed to be funny every time she opens her mouth. Her role is very supportive and a little dramatic. And while I questioned myself why was she even there for, it doesn't ultimately matter. She is another forgettable character that is given more importance than the role deserves.

Finally, the third act is weak. There's a balancing problem with stakes. You can't feel tension or weight to any action. And there's a lot of superficial ""I can't do it"" until they can.

In the end, this feels like a very safe plot, written in a way to appeal to china (considering how the Mandarin is portrayed), that ends up appealing to no one specific. Certainly doesn't feel like a Marvel movie.. but it was bound to happen if we are to be introduced to different aspects of the narrative. But it also doesn't feel like a comic book. It's more generic than that.","I got to admit I wasn't particularly blown away by anything in the movie.. I might even say ""I was bored"" by it.

819,819,Bold & Brilliant,"A bold step for the MCU, incorporating an Eastern cinema approach into it's franchise. With it's foundations built on choreography and humour, Shang-Chi beautifully brings in elements of famed Kung-Fu films and Chinese culture.

Taking inspiration from many martial arts, the action scenes - whilst exaggerated and outlandish in comparison to the film's peers - are brilliant. The addition of Kingsley is truly excellent too, as he and Awkwafina provide the majority of laughs.

A standalone plot whilst maintaining links to the MCU, Shangi-Chi creates a new platform for Marvel to explore, although clearly sets up the next Phase along with other releases from the year. The standout element is the creation of the new world and it's creatures though, a huge Disney budget bringing to life fabled animals long deserving of a spotlight.","A bold step for the MCU, incorporating an Eastern cinema approach into it's franchise.

821,821,The Master of Kung-fu,"Shang chi and the legend of the ten rings we follow the story of a guy named Shang(Simu Liu) who lives your basic life In San Francisco. Working as a Valet parking car, and partying late nights with his best friend Katy(Awkwafina). Until one day a band of assassins targets Shang and it's revealed that he's actually an assassin trained at birth by his father Wenwu(Tony Leung Chiu-Wai). The leader of the ten rings an ancient Chinese organization that's existence for thousands of years, conquering kingdoms and overthrowing governments. Now Shang-Chi must faces his father and overcome the demons of his past. Each of these Marvel films I find most enjoyable is the world building, set up of this universal series. All these characters from various backgrounds and classes and worlds. Shang-Chi I can say is one of those welcome new additions. Similar to Guardians of the galaxy when this was announced I hadn't the slightest idea who this guy was. Usually when people think Martial artists with marvel they usually think Iron fist or daredevil. So going into this I had a blank expectation of what to see. It does pay tribute to old-school martial arts films while mixing fast action charm of a comic book with a blend of Chinese mythology and philosophy. It does helps gives the movie an identity and the characters overall I found them good not great, but I found them entertaining and likable. Shang's more or less just an ordinary guy just trying to live his life. Have fun make a new start and make the best of it. He's honestly more or less happy with his basic life. Though at the same time running from his old life his father,mother and sister. It all leaves an impact on him as a person. He's pretty emotional not Peter Parker emotional, but he still has a personality outside of just having a stoic Shaolin fighter serious persona. They could have easily done a chosen one theme with him that been done to death. He likes to joke and have fun along with his friend Katy. Awkwafina I'm not a fan of her I didn't really care for her in crazy Rich Asians or Raya and the last dragon. Here I found her character more funny and likable. She doesn't really come off as that annoying friend that's more or less in the way. Her and Simu do play well off each other and display this friendship of two different people who still very similar. I got sort of Rush hour vibe off them, there's even a fight scene outside on a bamboo scaffolding. She's not just a pointless tagalong she does have moments where the jokes don't work , though she does add to the film specifically in the finale. The tone of the movie still finds time to flesh them out. More or less the two of them are just goofballs at the beginning, once more's revealed it does take time to have it's more deep serious moments. Wenwu I found to be a really good villain and While technically this still isn't really the Mandarin that comic readers we're probably expecting. His overall character is very compelling he more borders the line like killmonger. You understand his reasons though his actions are unjustifiable. He does still manages to gives off this somewhat opposing demeanor not from his fighting, but from the way he present his self. I buy this guy used to be a tyrant and a Conqueror. I still wish his rings worked the same way though, really he just throws them like chakra and whips them around. As for the sister she's given minimal in this not really alot of moments. Outside of her childhood flash backstory it's clear later down the road their gonna do something her. The visuals are stunning to this one water effect the just pops off the screen. The use of elements being shown through the right use of slow motion. The landscape of Tao lo which has this very traditional Chinese style with Nine-tail foxes, and Fu dog(lions) that make that the rhinos from black panther looks bad. I want to see more places like this in future installments. A lot of these cg effects are on par with doctor strange.","Shang chi and the legend of the ten rings we follow the story of a guy named Shang(Simu Liu) who lives your basic life In San Francisco.

The landscape of Tao lo which has this very traditional Chinese style with Nine-tail foxes, and Fu dog(lions) that make that the rhinos from black panther looks bad. I want to see more places like this in future installments. A lot of these cg effects are on par with doctor strange."
822,822,Simply entertaining,"When shang chi was announced in phase 4, i got excited because i am a fan of martial arts films. But after the pandemic, i slowly started losing interest in the film because i felt that mcu won't be as good after endgame and my fear turned true with the post endgame movies. None of the films or series satisfied me. I saw shang chi with low expectations and got fully satisfied.

What i loved about shang chi the most was its entertaining. Post endgame, mcu got burdened with expectations to connect their films into a universe, set up future films and do something different but in that process forgot to provide entertainment. On the other hand, shang chi is not burdened with any of these and tells a simple and independent story. There is no deliberate connecting to the mcu, nor they are in a hurry to set up any sequels, also its not anything different as its a typical Chinese martial arts mythological film. The action scenes in train and skyscraper were mindblowing and best hand to hand action scenes after winter soldier(which black widow failed to provide). The female stars were also badass. The climax cgi action was okay.

Only drawback is there is nothing new in the plot as its that typical mcu storyline where our hero has daddy issues.

On the whole, shang chi and the legend of ten rings is a very good standalone mcu film after thor ragnarok.","When shang chi was announced in phase 4, i got excited because i am a fan of martial arts films.

823,823,Exciting and heartwarming,,
824,824,A diverse new addition,"Shang Chi and the Legend of the Ten rings is one of the marvel's first phase 4 movies. In hindsight it has a underlying tone and story similar to that of Black Panther. Both being representations of certain groups and and their cultures.

The story is solid. It wasn't perfect as it had some minor flaws. A bit cheesy with good writing and comedy but nothing exceptional. The fight scenes , the choreography and dragons were cool which were refreshing compared to the last couple of MCU movies that were released. The characters are nothing to interesting other than Shang Chi and his dad and their whole dynamic.

Overall an enjoyable film. An eyecandy with some flaws but nonetheless was watchable and likable.

Memorable: No Rewatchable: Unlikely..","Shang Chi and the Legend of the Ten rings is one of the marvel's first phase 4 movies. In hindsight it has a underlying tone and story similar to that of Black Panther. Both being representations of certain groups and and their cultures.

825,825,"What a waste of time, the other way around geographically","Too unrealistic movie, with too much special effect that they do not bother to cover up. Humoristic moments do not seem that funny. Also, how a thin someone holdoff a big guy?

Ugh, it is that classic moves of Hollywood and phrases. Like the headphone did not hear you. Or foreigner moving oversea. Suddenly it looks like how they are picturing America especially in the cab. Like your pants joke, hell no phrase when looking at height. Or was looking everywhere for you. Burn it down. Classic moves like using multiple people as a stair.

Hate it also that sometimes they just speak English but mostly Chinese, wondering what they want.

How much did the Chinese pay Disney?

Using big actors and adding a new guy in to keep the quality of the acting, with a bad script it does not do well. Especially when there is no innovative action in the players. They were copy and paste from another movie they played before.

Classic scenarios making it so predictable, and fights that could not be won due to lack of experience are own suddenly.

Acting is below average, quality of screen is high but too much special effect, camera work is OK because it has gotten took over multiple of times by special effects so can not give any real points. Sound is below average because they're using too much overused kinds.

1 time only movie. Points are given to the cast because they still try to make something out of it but still not pulling tit off and meeting the script only. Some points for the innovativeness idea.","Too unrealistic movie, with too much special effect that they do not bother to cover up. Humoristic moments do not seem that funny.

826,826,Destin Daniel Cretton; you've done it again!,"Marvel's latest feature introduces cinephiles to Shaun AKA Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) a martial arts master and a character created by Steve Englehart and Jim Starlin, first appearing in a Marvel publication back in 1973. Beginning in the first of many gorgeously choreographed and shot sequences, we're introduced to Shang-Chi's father Xu Wenwu (Tony Chiu-Wai Leung) and mother Li (Fala Chen) also entailing the awesome power of the Ten Rings which Xu currently has in his possession. What follows is a heart-pounding and ridiculously entertaining adventure movie with true heart.

Filled with beautiful performances not least from everyone already mentioned and including Awkwafina as Shaun's best friends Katy and Meng'er Zhang as sister Xialing, there's plenty here to adore on screen not even getting to the truly awe-inspiring action set pieces with the best fight scenes I've seen in recent memory. Cretton (Short Term 12, Just Mercy) is very quickly becoming one of my favourite directors having produced three incredible pieces of cinema in the last 8 years. It's great to see that his passion for storytelling and independent spirit still shines through his latest here while also staying true to the Marvel fan base (I really did not expect a certain character to show up but made for some really comical moments).

The visual effects are of course stunning but what makes them stand out here are how they're incorporated with the beautiful landscapes to enhance the feeling of authentically experiencing Shaun's heritage and getting wrapped up in the culture that the filmmakers so wonderfully explore. This is how origin stories should be made! The creature design is also incredible and is an integral element to making the final sequences all the more breathtaking.

Please do yourselves a favour and see this on the biggest screens possible, please support your local cinema and stay safe my friends.","Marvel's latest feature introduces cinephiles to Shaun AKA Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) a martial arts master and a character created by Steve Englehart and Jim Starlin, first appearing in a Marvel publication back in 1973.

827,827,Not a good movie,"This movie was a fist in the face or rather a razor fist. I don't know if the movie is bad or I can't watch Marvel movies anymore but I didn't like anything about this movie, neither the story, nor the special effects, nor the acting. It all seemed too exaggerated and predictable, plus two hours is really too much for a movie of this type.

The only interesting parts were the first minutes where you see the meeting between the parents and the clash between the abomination and the monk whose name I don't remember.

I think instead the worst part was the final battle, even the too long and exaggerated one.","This movie was a fist in the face or rather a razor fist.

However, later in the film we constantly get some new elements, the story expands, there is not always an explanation, and the worst part of the film was my last fight because I think they went too far with special effects, for me personally it was not watchable. The bad guys overall were just solid, nothing special. Of course, at the end of the film we have a scene that shows us how to look for (at least) another film.","Solid pop corn film.

830,830,Finally something good again from Marvel,"Marvel has not done much good lately. 2 horrible TV shows, and 1 bad TV show. Not a single good movie since Captain Marvel, and nothing seemingly good coming over the horizon.

To be honest I have started to give up. Marvel have produced magnificent movies and great entertainment for many years, but lately it is like that magic has come off and they seem much more run of the mill basic with that, by now, boring Marvel feel. Marvel has tried to introduce more political correctness, more feminism, and more nonsense diversity, and it has all failed.

This movie however is not a failure.

Why?

This movie is simple, it is to the point, it follows tropes, cliches, and it is a classic heroes journey - which is exactly why it works!

Marvel took a classical story we all heard, read and seen before but they switched a few things around, kept some of that Marvel feel, and made it play out mainly in China and almost only with Chinese actors. And it works!

Imagine that? Sure you can find some political nonsense if you look hard enough, but who cares when you have great fight scenes, lovely sceneries, a great (but basic) story and brilliant well written characters.

We even get a villain that you understand, sympathise with and even feel a sting of ""ah, too bad"" about him.

This is how you make an action movie! Great stuff Marvel!

The points I deduct is due to the movie not being that amazing. They pull the heroes journey of sure, but we have also seen it done better. Sound is great, but not amazing, directing is great, but not amazing, etc. Etc. Everything about this movie is high class, greatly done, and well performed, but it is not on top, it is not amazing nor perfect.

I also have a few objections about the background story and the ending, but I am keeping this spoiler free so...

8/10. This is a great movie and highly entertaining, and definitely worth the ticket price. Go see and get your faith in Marvel restored.","Marvel has not done much good lately. 2 horrible TV shows, and 1 bad TV show.

At the very top tier of MCU movies - characters, lore, acting, action, fighting, visual effects! :-)","The entire cast was perfect, especially Simu Liu, Awkwafina, Tony Leung, Michelle Yeoh, Ben Kingsley, and Ronny Chieng! :-) Spectacular visual effects -and- awesome fight scenes! :-)","The entire cast was perfect, especially Simu Liu, Awkwafina, Tony Leung, Michelle Yeoh, Ben Kingsley, and Ronny Chieng! :-) Spectacular visual effects -and- awesome fight scenes! :-)"
834,834,"With Shang-Chi, Marvel presents their first Asian superhero in a good and cultural way.","Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is a new superhero movie in the Marvel film series. The film is directed and written in part by Destin Daniel Cretton, the director of Short Term 12 and Just Mercy.

The film is about Shaun (Simu Liu), who tries to put his past behind him and just wants to enjoy his life with his best friend Katy (Awkwafina). When the mysterious organization the Ten Rings finds Shaun, he is forced to confront his past after all. To do this, he must take his birth name Shang-Chi again, to protect Katy and his sister Xialing (Meng'er Zhang) from the actions of the Ten Rings and their leader Xu WenWu the Mandarin (Tony Chiu-Wai Leung) who is also Shaun. His father.

This film is Marvel's first superhero film starring an Asian actor. Furthermore, with this film they also bring out the Asian culture and fighting styles well. For this they have used other movies like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon as an example. Fans of this film can recognize moments that refer back to these films. They portray the fight scenes where characters fight each other with Asian fighting styles well and entertainingly. The art of the Asian fighting style is somewhat overshadowed when characters use more supernatural powers in the film. Fight scenes where this happens are less exciting and entertaining than scenes where characters fight each other in more normal ways.

At one point, the film also feels like you're watching a live-action mix of the Asian animation shows Pokémon and Avatar: The Last Airbender. These scenes provide some extra comedy and are especially more entertaining for younger viewers. The movies and costumes of the film cast also help with the emergence of Asian culture in the film. The visual effects are also put to good use in the film. Except for a few scenes, it can be seen that they have used a green screen for the background, but fortunately this is not disturbing in the film. Creatures can also be returned before the start of the film. A bit redundant on a few action scenes with 3D effects in the film.

The acting is well done by the film cast. Simu Liu took to Twitter to ask Marvel to play the part, with both parties quickly making a good deal. Simu Liu comes across as good and charismatic as the lead of the film and further conveys the action sequences beautifully. Along with Awkwafina, he also has good chemistry in the film and together provide good appropriate humor. The comedy also doesn't overshadow all the dramatic aspects in the film, which sometimes does happen. Tony Chiu-Wai Leung also portrays the villain of the film in a good and sympathetic way, so that as a viewer you understand why he does what he is doing to me. This film is also only his first English-language role in an American film. Although this is only his first time, he still delivers good and appropriate acting.

It depends a lot on the visual effects, its main characters can be funny but not nice, the story does not generate much interest and we have seen the fights many times and in a better way in almost any film produced in Hong Kong, Indonesia or Thailand of the last twenty years. The only thing that saves this film is the karaoke scene that is unexpectedly welcome. The rest is routine, mediocre, tiring and bland.","Let's agree that it is a bad movie from multiple points of view.

Marvel's Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is much more than the trailer/teaser revealed! First ten minutes or so or so in chinese!

I think it's a good thing to have such a major and big representation of Asian characters, especially nowadays with Anti-Asian hate/crime rising. The film had a pure theatrical release, instead of the Black Widow treatment (which also was available on Disney plus and the cinemas at the same time) The movie does not have that as a topic, it is entertainment after all, but in every promo and interview that the actors were involved it was something that was mentioned.

I think it's a good thing to have such a major and big representation of Asian characters, especially nowadays with Anti-Asian hate/crime rising. The film had a pure theatrical release, instead of the Black Widow treatment (which also was available on Disney plus and the cinemas at the same time) The movie does not have that as a topic, it is entertainment after all, but in every promo and interview that the actors were involved it was something that was mentioned. Now waiting for the other stuff to drop, especially after the mid credit scene, that is such a tease!"
845,845,Average,"It's good action movie. Firstly, the scenario is pretty good, but it has nothing special, it's a little bit predictable. Secondly, the cast is awesome, I really like Akwafina in her role, she is very funny. Also I like Simu Lu as main character he is charismatic person. But my favourite is one character from past film of MCU (don't want to give spoiler). Thirdly, I like how the atmosphere of ancient Chinese culture was shown, but for me I want more. Fourthly, the fighting is good too.

So, it's nice MCU film.","It's good action movie. Firstly, the scenario is pretty good, but it has nothing special, it's a little bit predictable.

848,848,Another fabulous addition to MCU's Phase 4!,"The much-awaited Shangi Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings released today in theatres. It follows the journey of Shang Chi (Simu Liu), the son of the famed MCU villain the Mandarin, who revolts against his father to fight evil.

The first stand-alone film featuring an Asian American superhero, Shang Chi understandably stands out with its close combat sequences. All the actors and especially Simu Liu have undergone extensive martial arts training and it shows, with a sensational sequence on a moving bus in San Francisco and another on a bamboo scaffolding in Macau, the standouts.

Awkwafina and a surprise returning character from the MCU provide genuine, sarcasm-laced comedy that adds another wonderful layer to the experience. Cameos from Benedict Wong and Ronnie Chieng also manage to leave the audience in spits.

Without stooping to cultural appropriation, with an all-Asian crew, director Destin Daniel Cretton pays rich tribute to Chinese heritage at every turn. Hong Kong's superstars Tony Leung and Michelle Yeoh are electric in their roles and the fact that they don't seem to have lost a step with age, acing their action sequences, shows their dedication as performers.

Regarded as one of the finest actor's Chinese cinema has every produced, Tony Leung stamps his class all over the film, giving an engrossing, captivating performance as the dreaded leader of the Ten Rings.

His inner moral dilemmas and love/hate relationship with his children are portrayed brilliantly by the man nicknamed 'Small Tiger' among the Five Tiger Generals of Hong Kong Cinema

The flashback sequences help to build up Shang Chi as a character and intricately captures his upbringing as the heir-apparent to a genocidal megalomaniac, and how despite wanting nothing to do with his father's murderous tendencies, as his son, he is inadvertently drawn to the Mandarin's world of violence and carnage.

The films delves into mystical elements towards the climax and with two surprise-laden post-credit sequences tie into both Doctor Strange's world of Mystic Arts as well as a possible connection that the Ten Rings has to alien technology.

As always, the way weaves in each individual fim character to the wonderful tapestry that makes up each of its Phases is a joy in itself.

It is due to the well-written characters and the nuanced acting of its performers that Shang Chi stands out while the eye-catching CGI and elaborately chorographer action sequences add more gloss to the end product.

Another wonderful new addition to the MCU world and hopefully this paves the way for more ethnicities being represented in the universe as time goes on.

849,849,Miscast,"I'm sorry but the leading man here is a definite miscast. Or is it because Tony Leung and Awkwfina stole the show? Hmmmmmm......

While the MCU movies are getting too formulaic I'm hesitant to say the next 10 year is starting out rather uninteresting. Shang Chi is basically a Chinese cash grab in the lineage of Black Panther. It is uninspiring, routine and CGI oriented.

Back to casting the main lead, I'm suggesting either John Cho (star trek, Cowboy Bobep,) or Chang Chen (Dune) would be an upgrade. While Falan Chen is sufficient the role is a thankless one. As to the story I would love to see more of grandma and take out Ben Kingsley's.

I mean Hawkeye series is better, if how so ever slightly. I understand the fantastic elements are tributes to the Chinese culture. Of course Kingsley and that strange pet is trying hard to be comedic but is rather forced. Overall it's a surface scratcher only. So disappointed.","I'm sorry but the leading man here is a definite miscast. Or is it because Tony Leung and Awkwfina stole the show? Hmmmmmm......

Thanks to scintillating cast who lit up the screen especially charismatic Tony Leung.

Chemistry between Simu & Awkwafina as besties are undeniably good.

Simu Liu is the perfect Marvel protagonist, and Awkwafina delivers the obligatory yet welcomed dose of humor you'd come to expect from a Marvel presentation.

But beyond that this movie is rich with mythology, adventure, and incredible martial arts combat that cannot be described with another phrase other than breathtaking, to be the introduction of a new character the story is well-written and you feel as if he had been with us from the start,

I give this move the 10 it deserves, In Marvel We Trust.","Let me commence by saying this movie is by far one of the most-fun, action packed Marvel movies ever!

This movie is the Asian one, taking inspiration from Chinese Mythology and Kung-Fu in this action-adventure. Great fight scenes and chases expertly shot, the downside is that most of it looks entirely computer generated. The comedian I don't like made me disappointed again, but once the 2nd comedic side kick joined it was a lot more funny. Strong start, middling middle and an ending which lacked motivation.

That being said, the middle 45 minutes of this film had me nearly falling asleep, literally. The character development just couldn't hook me at all because it felt like they kept revisiting the same points.

On a positive note, the visuals and martial arts are absolutely spectacular. The first act of the film contains most of the martial arts and it is so crisp and well-choreographed. The final act flexes all of the CGI dollas and they make they already big budget stretch far, with some of the more impressive sights you will see in a Marvel movie so far. This movie didn't quite hit the 8/10 for me to recommend people see it in theatres, but lets tack that up to me being tired and you go see it anyway!","Let me preface this by saying that my enjoyment of the movie may have been dampered by a poor night's sleep.

860,860,Vey Nice,"Thoroughly enjoyed watching this movie. Not one bit is boring and the comedy is really good and appropriate and not cringey like some other Marvel movies.

This is not an ""8"" 8 for me, but it's not a 7 either, more like 7.6 but then again, IMDb doesn't have half stars for some reasons.

The fight choreography is amazing and this one has some of the best hand-to-hand action in Marvel. It kinda gets ridiculous in the end and you feel like it's not in the MCU, but MCU is already ridiculous so this is not that far-fetched.

The acting of all of them was good especially the father.

The ""villain"" is really relatable and well-written, even though I felt like we needed more time with him, this much is enough to make you actually feel and understand why he does what he does and is kinda not the bad guy.

The story and characters could've used some more fleshing out, especially Shaun's sister.

Story and characters might be cliché but they use those clichés well and make you care about these characters and that's the most important part. I just wish there was more showing and not telling.

The CGI was not that good and it's really noticeable especially at the end. They should've worked on it more and polished it.

Not using gore and cuss words because they want their movies to be PG-13 really hurts these movies, even though they can use at least one f word but for some reason they don't, I'm not saying that f word can make the movie better, but sometimes you need something more than ""dam"" for the scene to be more impactful. Also, doesn't actually showing most of the flashbacks make them more impactful? Why does the camera turn away from the ""death"" scenes that can make the movie better? This is why not showing a little bit of blood and gore hurts these movies, these movies keep pulling their punches back, and believe me no one cares if you used some more gruesome scenes. How are you gonna make a Deadpool 3 and Blade movie then?

All in all, very enjoyable movie with good martial arts fights, characters, music choice, and a decent story. I might like it better when I see it a second time, but right now I'm kinda lukewarm about it. Really looking forward to seeing more of what Shang-Chi's gonna do in the MCU.","Thoroughly enjoyed watching this movie.

First off, I loved all the characters, such as Shang-Chi, Katy, Xu Wenwu, Xialing, Razor Fist, Death Dealer, the return of Trevor Slattery, Morris, and of course Master Guang Bo. The actors for all these characters were also perfect. They suited their roles perfectly. In my opinion, this movie had some of the best supporting characters in the MCU. I also loved the action. It was absolutely amazing, there were some points in the movie where I felt like I was watching a martial arts movie. The stunts and the choreography were perfect, I couldn't have asked for anything more. The effects in this movie were also stunning. The moving forest, the mythical creatures (especially the dragon), and the effects used on the Ten Rings were super cool. The effects in this movie were some of the best in the MCU. Lastly, I also loved the plot, it just sat really well with me.

This movie was like nothing we have ever seen before in the MCU. It was very unique and a nice twist for Marvel. The first Credit Scene was also very interesting and might have set up phase 4 in the MCU.

863,863,A solid superhero adventure...,"Like many, I was concerned that this new Marvel Cinematic Universe saga would have trouble living up to previous standards but Shang-Chi has already left me hopeful for the series' future. I literally know nothing about this character but I found his film debut to be a solid superhero adventure; well acted, effectively character-driven, occasionally funny, rich with cultural representation and booming with swift and stylized martial arts action. It has what I hoped I was going to get from Black Panther: inclusivity AND an interesting world and narrative. I'm 100% all for representation but the story and characters must be pronounced, too and I just found this entry to be a lot more distinguished and captivating.

Although Shang-Chi treads the familiar origin story formula, there's a few fresh twists and turns that uniquely sets this character's journey apart from the others. Though the first half is decently entertaining with some identifiable drama and fast-paced yet slightly derivative set-pieces in urban environments, the second half is where the film really turns on (at least for me). The Chinese philosophy kicks in, the mythology is abundant, there's tons of visually striking imagery, a fantastical setting, loads of insane action choreography. The Asian representation is just off the chain and I was so enraptured by it. It doesn't feel contrived, I sensed a great deal of respect for it and all the while an engaging story was unfolding. A nice balance. I was very satisfied with what I saw. I'm really looking forward to seeing more of Shang-Chi's world and how it'll tie in with other stories yet-to-come. Very cool movie. Soulful, cultural and action-packed.","Like many, I was concerned that this new Marvel Cinematic Universe saga would have trouble living up to previous standards but Shang-Chi has already left me hopeful for the series' future.

The real Mandarin makes his debut and does not disappoint, Tony Chiu-Wai Leung was fantastic. All the other cast members were very likable as well.

Well, now we know. A painfully spavined production that begs Flu Bear to approve it right from the first subtitled moment with excruciatingly ""Mandarin"" performances that even a barely trained White ear can detect as being more Californian than Chongqing.

Then the movie proper starts, and we're inflicted with Nora Lum, who has built her career on appropriating and exploiting Blackness. Wow. Nora Lum, in the current year.

Granted, the Mandarin Empire loathes Black people even more than Nora Lum does, but it's still startling to see her not only accepted but showcased.

Oh, the movie?

Eh, who cares? It's all ropey CGI, overblown score, infantile plot, cringe dialogue, and a truly tragic performance by Michelle Yeo who I wish had had the integrity to turn down this opportunity.

Final context: I wept three times during Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon: once in joy, once in sadness, once in astonishment.

I wept once during this... thing... in despair. Then I bailed, hard.

It's not OK to pander to Winnie the Flu. It's NOT OK.","What do you get when you have no idea what you are creating beyond ""Rip off successful Cantonese Han movies, so that the Mouse can sell the product to Flu Bear""?

Well, now we know. A painfully spavined production that begs Flu Bear to approve it right from the first subtitled moment with excruciatingly ""Mandarin"" performances that even a barely trained White ear can detect as being more Californian than Chongqing.

Then the movie proper starts, and we're inflicted with Nora Lum, who has built her career on appropriating and exploiting Blackness. Wow. Nora Lum, in the current year.

Well, I was let down, and judging by the other reviews ALOT of other people were too. People are not going to put up with this crap for too much longer. I mean how many bad movies can Disney make in a row and expect people to continue to watch them?

I see Disney even tried to even throw some Anti American talk into this movie to try to get on China's good side....but even that did not work. China did not allow their citizens to watch it. I guess Disney will have to put even more Anti American talk into the next movie.

You messed up Star Wars Disney. Now you are messing up every Marvel movie. Maybe wokeness is not the way to go. PLEASE can someone buy Marvel from Disney before its too late??

872,872,Worst story and plot ever.,"This is by far the most nonsensical plot in a Marvel film and one of the worst stories I've ever witnessed. It's so hard to make sense of anything at all in this film. The only good thing is some of the action sequences. Bus fight is spectacular but after that it goes completely downhill cause only after that does the plot actually unfold. And it is so ridiculous and so full of nonsense that I was thoroughly bored whenever anything other than the fight scenes were on.

I think Marvel is done. This phase seems completely relying on the success of the previous one. The only good thing is Spider-Man and I'm eagerly looking forward to No Way Home. After this I don't have any expectations from Marvel films other than Spider-Man.

The humour in this movie is pure cringe. It feels too forced and Awkwafina is completely out of place. The last scene where they sing Hotel California is so damn cringy. It's a tragedy that they thought people would enjoy it. This is a really bad film minus the action sequences. Watch it only for the action which looks good on the big screen. Don't have even the slightest expectation from the story.","This is by far the most nonsensical plot in a Marvel film and one of the worst stories I've ever witnessed.

879,879,Precious ... ten times,"Of course I am just riffing off, teasing and making fun of certain things with my summary line. Though there is some truth in there too - especially if you consider the last third of the movie - quite fantastical, pun intended.

But there is so much more here. And while you may have seen the bus scene already (I imagine many times), it still is quite the highlight and works wonders! Because there is even more to it than the trailer/teaser revealed! As is with the plot and the characters of the movie.

I was able to watch it on an Imax screen and let me tell you ... wow! But also wow and much respect to Marvel and Feige and anyone involved that they dared to make the first ten minutes or so in chinese! And throwing a lot of chinese terms (slang?) in there as well - throughout! That gives it a touch of authenticity. How immigrants in America or anywhere else in the world grew up. I do the same with my Greek and German/English.

It is also nice and while I am prone to be sarcastic, I really think it's a good thing to have such a major and big representation - especially nowadays with Anti-Asian hate/crime rising. All because of people blaming China and people of China for a virus ... the movie does not have that as a topic, it is entertainment after all, but in every promo and interview that the actors were involved it was something that was mentioned. Good for them and good for us, that this was made.

I am a bit biased when it comes to the MCU and this did get a pure theatrical release, instead of the Black Widow treatment (which also was available on Disney plus and the cinemas at the same time). So there is not issue when it comes to that. And if you can watch it on the big screen - you will not be dissapointed! Now waiting for the other stuff to drop ... especially after the mid credit scene, that is such a tease ... the after the credits scene might also hint at something, but the bigger tease was midway through the credits (actually almost at the beginning of them to be honest).

Sit back and enhoy the movie and the really funny characters ... and quite a few familiar faces. Some from the MCU and previous entries but also some from Asian cinema!

881,881,Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,,
882,882,The best Marvel movie so far...,"Having seen the trailer for the 2021 Marvel action movie ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" I must admit that of course I was going to watch it, but I feared it would just be another run-of-the-mill-over-the-top-CGI-fest-but-barred-of-proper-contents Marvel movie. Yet, I opted to sit down and watch it, on the notion that it was a Marvel movie. But also because of the cast that starred in it.

And yeah, this movie was over the top in terms of CGI. Of course it was, because it is a Marvel movie after all. But luckily this movie broke the formula of the archetypical Marvel movie and this actually turned out to be the best Marvel movie so far. Well, at least in my opinion. Why? Well, because of the storyline and the fact that it mixed Asian culture and lore into the Marvel cinematic universe, and it was a much needed addition to an otherwise Western-focused series of movies.

The storyline told in ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"", as written by Dave Callaham, Destin Daniel Cretton and Andrew Lanham was certainly entertaining. And the movie didn't really have a dull moment, despite the fact that it was a movie that ran for 132 minutes. I thoroughly enjoyed the entire movie from beginning to end. And for me, this was a storyline with proper contents to it, that also included interesting characters and creatures.

Visually then ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" blew me away. The CGI team really worked their magic with this movie and brought it to life in a very visually fulfilling way. Lots of nice details and jaw-dropping special effects. And the creature designs in the movie were off the charts, I really enjoyed seeing those brought to life on the screen.

The character gallery in ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" was interesting, and that applies for both the villain and good guy side.

And they had such a great cast ensemble put together for ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"", with the likes of Asian cinema heavy weighters such as Tony Chiu-Wai Leung, Michelle Yeoh and Wah Yuen. But the movie was also nicely carried by Simu Liu, whom I was not familiar with prior to this movie. And also having Awkwafina in the movie was just brilliant, because she put on a spot on performance with her comedy sidekick character. And it was interesting and nice to see Ben Kingsley return to reprise his character of Trevor Slattery.

""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" is a good combination of action and narrative storytelling, which made for a very wholesome movie. And it should be said that the action sequences were breathtaking to behold, so very, very nicely choreographed and executed on the screen, taking that traditional Wuxia elements seen in Asian movies and mixing it in with the archetypical Marvel Western-based superhero movies.

I was more than genuinely entertained by ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" and it is certainly a movie that bolsters Marvel's hold for me, as their movies tend to be super flashy with spectacular effects, but rather hollow in terms of proper entertainment and storytelling.

My rating of ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" lands on a well-deserved nine out of ten stars. Director Destin Denial Cretton ensured that this 2021 movie takes the role of the single best Marvel movie to date for me.","Having seen the trailer for the 2021 Marvel action movie ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" I must admit that of course I was going to watch it, but I feared it would just be another run-of-the-mill-over-the-top-CGI-fest-but-barred-of-proper-contents Marvel movie.

884,884,Ten Years too Late,,
885,885,Indeed legendary,"It's been ten years since Shang-Chi(Liu, charming, stoic) last saw his father, and leader of the criminal empire The Ten Rings, Wenwu(Leung, charismatic enough that we feel a lot of empathy for him, even when he does terrible things that we desperately want him to stop doing). That was also when he last spent time with his sister, Xialing(Zhang, a badass who deserves more screen time. Honestly, I'd be very surprised if she didn't, in future projects). He's joined by his friend Katy(Awkwafina, quirky, providing a lot of comic relief, something I'm told she's in general adept at), for what can best be described as a tense reunion, which allows the movie to really mine the family melodrama, one of the best elements it has. I won't give away exactly what the antagonist intends to do, only that our hero has to stop him. However, he has to figure out how, maybe even if, that is even possible.

Not quite, yet almost ""Black Panther for Asian audiences"", this does a lot for representation(including for women. Some of the best characters in this are female. In addition to the two that I've already mentioned, there is also Ying Nan(Yeoh, wise)), it is positively drenched in Chinese culture(the third act, while in ways it feels like it belongs to a completely different film than the first two, takes an especially deep dive into that. Ultimately, it is presented through a Western lens, and clearly we need to go further in this direction, still, it is a big deal that they put so much of it in an estimated $150 to 200 million major blockbuster, which will be seen by millions of people who would never consider watching an art picture, especially one focusing on a group they don't belong to), to the point where countless times, when it makes sense, major characters in this speak Mandarin to each other, rather than English, which it is subtitled into. And ""don't worry"", for those who think that the following is important: there are white people on screen, and they aren't made out to be ""less than"".

The action(each sequence of which feels distinct, belongs with the rest, and is memorable) pays tribute to many different kinds of martial arts films, acknowledging that they are standing on the shoulders of giants. Jackie Chan, wuxia, etc. The choreography is matched in skill by the cinematography. Not only are we seeing incredible fighting, the camera is dynamic, celebrating and highlighting how incredible it is. That *is* why you hire Bill Pope, the director of photography on the Matrix trilogy, two of Sam Raimi's Spider-Man entries, Darkman and Team America. The special effects are excellent. There are some issues with pacing, and certainly a chunk of this is composed almost entirely of flashbacks.

This features relatively brief but highly concentrated, surprisingly graphic gore(you know, there was a time when the fact that it's happening to beings that clearly are not human, wasn't enough to get away with this kind of thing with a PG-13 rating. Pepperidge Farm remembers), as well as a little strong language. I recommend this to any fan of comic book movie adaptations, and people passionate about diversity hiring. 8/10.","It's been ten years since Shang-Chi(Liu, charming, stoic) last saw his father, and leader of the criminal empire The Ten Rings, Wenwu(Leung, charismatic enough that we feel a lot of empathy for him, even when he does terrible things that we desperately want him to stop doing).

Some might find it over the top but it's a Marvel so what do you expect? To me this is one of Marvels best movies yet if not the best. The acting was good as well, and that from the whole cast. I never heard of Shang-Chi before but from now he has one more fan. Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings won't disappoint a lot of people, unless you're just not into this genre of movies.

890,890,A Marvel for the whole family.,"""The US government was almost toppled by a pretender named after an orange."" Wenwu (Tony Leung)

This quote is typical of the light-hearted but also serious addition to the MCU that is Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings. Although Marvel has always been less serious than DC, this time it leaves Superman and Batman to cry in their capes. Sweet superhero Sean/Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) has more humanity than almost any other hero, and he uses his martial arts only when pressed.

The opening sequence on a bus (you can see the bad coming from other cinematic bus rides such as in Nobody) is rousing and entertaining. It has a fight sequence I laughed through because of its ballet-like composition but satisfying because it sets up character and motivation.

When things get heavy, and they do because Sean must confront and potentially kill his 1000-year-old mobster dad, Wenwu, Awkwafina's Katy, Sean's girlfriend, is there with amusing one-liners throughout the adventure, right down to a life-saving shot in the big ending battle scene.

Director Destin Daniel Cretton deftly orchestrates his fights and his characters' lines with the authority of a much more seasoned filmmaker. He never loses sight of the central motif-the affirmation of family primacy, so that the potential chaos of a giant cast and multiple plot strands hosts a unity glued by character and dialogue.

He never loses sight of the central motif-the affirmation of family primacy, so that the potential chaos of a giant cast and multiple plot strands hosts a unity glued by character and dialogue.

Shang-Chi is a Marvel for the whole family and especially the cinephiles curious how The Marvel Cinematic Universe can be so diverse, so entertaining, and so perfect a purveyor of our heroic fantasies."

892,892,The legend of the ten Marvel movies a year for all eternity.,"'Shang-Chi And The Legend Of The Ten Rings (2021)' is, essentially, exactly what you expect it to be. Not only does it feel like a Marvel movie, it feels like a literal Disney movie as well. This is often detrimental to the overall affair, as the piece should have been much more unique than it ultimately is, and it makes for a much less interesting watch overall. However, the formula it follows has provided plenty of success in the past; this time is no exception. Its highs are where you'd expect them to be, as are its lows, and there is an undeniable sense of fun, albeit cookie-cutter fun, to be had. The film is an entertaining action adventure that follows a young man whose criminal father calls him and his sister back home in order to lay siege to the mystical village he believes is holding his wife, the protagonist's mother, hostage. The villain's motivation is a little underexplored yet entirely understandable. It comes from a believable emotional place and is more satisfying because of it. The relationship between the lead and his no-good dad isn't explored as much as it could be, though, and the flick generally has a bit of a theming issue. The piece tries to tie its events directly into the wants and needs of its lead characters, but it does so in an unsatisfyingly half-baked way and honestly would probably have been better if it played itself as more of a straightforward adventure ala most of the 'Mission: Impossible (1996-)' series. Still, the touches of character development are appreciated and each lead player is written to be as likeable as possible. This, combined with the amicable performances, means that you care about the heroes even though you don't have all that much reason to. This keeps you invested in their stories throughout. The highlight of the entire affair is, for sure, its action. For the most part, the picture stays towards the right end of the practical to CG spectrum. The fights are never exactly realistic, per se, but they're based on competent choreography and clean camerawork. They're, more often than not, really entertaining. Sadly, the flick inches closer and closer towards the wrong end of the aforementioned spectrum the longer it goes on. By the time it reaches its finale (which gives me major 'Fast And Furious Presents Hobbs And Shaw (2019)' vibes for some reason), it's clear that the balance it previously achieved is going to go out of the window. Sure enough, its climactic battle is an entirely computer-generated affair; it isn't all that compelling and goes directly against what made the movie so enjoyable to begin with. No matter how hard it tries to disguise it, it still ends with a big blue beam in the sky. Still, the finale isn't exactly bad. It's just annoyingly intangible and feels a little forced in, even (as do the rather cringe-worthy post-credits scenes). Ultimately, this is a generic yet entertaining experience. Its charming acting and exciting action are clearly its highlights, and its weakest aspects are still decent enough. It's a good movie. However, I can't deny that Marvel fatigue is becoming more and more pertinent in my mind. You know what you're going to get before you get it. Plus, the studio's insistence that it has to perforate every single outing with references to other, almost entirely irrelevant fare is really annoying. Although most of their movies are at least okay, I find myself not caring at all about them. That's sad, really, considering that the MCU has produced some genuinely great pictures in the past. 7/10.","'Shang-Chi And The Legend Of The Ten Rings (2021)' is, essentially, exactly what you expect it to be.

893,893,Fun martial arts action-comedy with some dragon ex machina,"After a flashback, this movie jumps to a couple of slackers, Shaun and Katy, with Shaun proving during a wild bus ride that he is much more than a car attendant. Soon they're on a globe hoping adventure with world-saving dimensions.

The martial arts choreography is terrific, from the opening forest fight through that fantastic bus bit to the final hand-to-hand battle (followed by the big special effects battle seemingly required in every Marvel film). Fights are funny and exciting and that final battle is truly suspenseful.

The cast is also excellent. Awkwafina is as funny as ever, Michelle Yeoh and Tony Leung bring all their seasoned expertise to their roles, and the actors are don't know are also first rate.

Although ... in the case of Simu Liu, who plays Shaun/Shang-Chi, I have no strong opinion. He's a pleasant every man who handles the action scenes well but seems less mythic hero than ""genial best friend of the main character."" With all the other talent on screen he doesn't manage to leave much of an impression, but on the bright side I don't object to him.

The story is fun, the movie does a good job of mixing humor, action, and tragical reminiscences the pace is terrific, and man there are some great fights.

894,894,my eyes couldn't handle the sheer awesomeness on the screen,"Watch this in IMAX!!!! The entire movie has an expanded aspect ratio. You're watching about 70% of the image on normal screens, plus on way smaller screens with worse speakers. I promise, it's worth it

WOWOWOWOWOW. This movie blew me away. I love it. A LOT. From beginning to end. Everything. I walked out of the movie so hyped, silent-screaming under my mask as i walked to the car. It's been a while since i walked out of a movie this happy. I have so much to say.

I love the MCU (a lot), but there are a few things that are frequently lacking. One of them is good fight scenes. They always have awesome action scenes, but specifically fight scenes are usually pretty good, only great in a few movies like civil war and winter soldier. And in general, fight scenes in American movies pale in comparison to Asian cinema (Ip man, The Raid Redemption, anything Jackie Chan).

The fight scenes in this movie.... how do i describe it... amazing martial arts that's fast but clear, filmed in creative and astonishing ways without a hint of shaky cam or quick cuts, against stunningly beautiful backdrops... phenomenal. And they continuously focus on the fights instead of cutting to a different scene after 10 seconds like i've noticed in the MCU.

This is BY FAR the best fighting in the MCU and it's not even close. Has to be up there with the John Wick series and Netflix's Daredevil as some of the best we've seen in America lately. I loved the first major fight scene so much that i was worried it would be the best one of the movie, far too early. Lol. I be stupid sometimes

Another frequent flaw in the MCU is lack of compelling villain. Nope. Awesome awesome awesome. That's all i'll say.

Another of my frequent complaints is that the musical scores, with some exceptions, don't stand out. I think they heard. They're on a good streak with the shows and Black Widow. It's not as amazing as the Loki score but i liked it. It felt unique to this new franchise.

Still so much more to say, need to go faster. This is one of the best, maybe THE best, story in the MCU, especially the way it's told. I loved all the characters, i loved all the casting choices, i loved the performances. There are scenes of dialogue that gave me goosebumps. All the emotional moments hit. All the callbacks hit. There isn't anything that didn't work for me. There's no such thing as a perfect movie, but mannnnnn.

Lmao i didn't mention the cinematography. Why would i wait this long? It's MESMERIZING. A lot. Throughout. It's candy for your eyes.

It's also nice to see well-written comedy with jokes relevant to the scene and characters, that feels organic. As opposed to the ""insert joke here"" method we've been seeing more of, especially in Far From Home.

What's the opposite of formulaic? That's this movie. I never knew what to expect next (helps that i didn't watch a single trailer, they ruin movies). Definitely doesn't feel like a typical MCU movie. It has it's own unique tone and feel and character.

Continuing what i said in my headline, i have this thing where i get goosebumps and start tearing up, not from an emotional moment, but from a scene being so incredible, especially action scenes. Don't know why it happens, don't know if it happens to other ppl. Maybe it's partly because i can't risk blinking. That happened in this movie numerous times. Like ""this is the coolest thing i've ever seen in my life."" hyperbole, but mannnnn

after endgame finished phase 3 (yes i know spider-man), i was so happy and satisfied with the MCU. But i wasn't sure they could ever recapture that magic again. I knew i would watch everything and it would probably mostly be awesome. But i wasn't expecting top-tier stuff any more. Lol. I be stupid sometimes. I am ecstatic to have that notion obliterated. As of now, this is a top 6 MCU movie for me. Wow

All in all, i adore this movie. You may wonder why i wouldn't give it a 10 after all this raving. 10s are super rare for me, only 13 of them, and i watch thousands of movies. Interstellar, inception, mad max fury road, etc. Movies that shouldn't even be called movies. My 9s are rare too, they are my favorite movies. 10s are my favorites of my favorites. Only superhero movies i've given 10s are dark knight, dark knight rises and civil war.

If you're still reading, wow you're awesome! I think this is my longest review other than Interstellar.

I'm still in such a good mood. I can't wait to watch it again, in IMAX. I want to wait a week so it feels fresher, but i might not be able to!

We get some absolutely amazing fight scenes which seem right out of a classic Chinese martial arts movie. My only complaint is that it is a bit too long.

904,904,Shang Empty,"Sorry for the delay.

Here we go...

I'm not feeling this movie. It starts with promise but It lost me after Wong vs Abomb.

The fighting is exciting. The movie lacks excitement though. It's a plain dull movie.

It's about a Karate master and... yeah the movie lost me and I have know idea what it's about. This is the first mcu film that I lost interest for midway. Even Im3 wasn't so bad because I lost interest from the very beginning.

Gotg2, mcu Spiderman 1/2 and IM3 are still the worse in mcu. Shang Chi just joined the club.

A movie so full of emptiness that it makes an empty box jealous

I'm not sure how this is a 7. Fans and the average movie goer should also be held responsible for horrible movies.

This movie ain't a 7 even if you watched this movie as blind and drunk.

They tried to be funny by having Wong be rude by drinking the couple's drink at the end credit scene. That wasn't funny at all. Wizard or not.

Speaking of funny, I didn't laugh once. When I used to watch these movies in theatres, the audience often told me when I should have laughed. I watched it at home, therefore I didn't know my cue of when to laugh.

The mcu needs to chill with the daddy issue plot

THOR Loki daddy issue Black Panta daddy issues Stark Daddy issues Star lord Daddy issues Ultron daddy issues Nebula and Gamora daddy issues Shang daddy issue Wasp daddy issues Scott langs daughter Daddy issues

Speaking of funny, I didn't laugh once. When I used to watch these movies in theatres, the audience often told me when I should have laughed. I watched it at home, therefore I didn't know my cue of when to laugh.

905,905,Masterpiece...,"""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" is an Action - Fantasy movie in which we watch a new era of Marvel Studios rise with Shang-Chi, the master of Kung Fu. He has to face his past involving him with the Ten Rings organization and crate his future accordingly.

I have to admit that I had my doubts about this movie but I was proven very wrong since it's an amazing movie. It has a beautiful and very interesting plot that keeps you in tense through its whole duration consisted of plenty of action and nice CGIs. For one more time Marvel succeeded on creating a nice atmosphere and connecting the previous movies with this one with many Easter Eggs so, we expect more in the near future. The interpretation of Simu Liu who played as Shaun / Shang-Chi was simply outstanding and he made the difference. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Tony Chiu-Wai Leung's who played as Xu Wenwu, Michelle Yeoh's who played as Ying Nan, Meng'er Zhang's who played as Xialing and Awkwafina's who played as Katy. The comic relief role of Ben Kingsley as Trevor Slattery was a brilliant idea that also gave something different in the movie. Finally, I have to say that ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" is an amazing movie and I strongly recommend everyone to watch it, especially the fans of Marvel.","""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" is an Action - Fantasy movie in which we watch a new era of Marvel Studios rise with Shang-Chi, the master of Kung Fu.

911,911,"Epic, stunning, and a strong powerhouse story.","5 out of 5 stars.

Shang-Chi and the legend of the Ten Rings is an awesome and exciting mcu film that brings the stunning world with the asian culture. I will say i enjoyed this more than the previous mcu film Black Widow. Shang Chi introduces a new mcu character played by Simu Liu. And Awkwafina which is also a fun addition. While they are being chased by an organization called ten rings. Lead by his father Tony Leung. While Shang Chi learns his abilities and the ten rings. Before his father is trying to use that power for a personal reason.

Great epic plot. Shang Chi and Katy (Awkwafina) enter a hidden world Ta Lao where there is magical mythical creatures. Is like a wow stunning moment when you first see Wakanda in Black Panther. The film does give an emotional story build up and a villain that can be relatable.

The cast ensemble is great. Simu Liu did great with the character along with Awkwafina as his friend. Meng'er Zhang, Michelle Yeoh, Benedict Wong, Florian Munteanu, and Tong Leung all did great.

The set designs and visual effects are stunning and great. Can be colorful at moments. The music score was good as well. The action sequences are great and exciting. Every set piece had an awesome martial arts choreography which was well shot with the cinematography. Director did a great job in capturing the action and fight sequences. Even with the epic climax of the dragon battle.

There are two mid and post credit scene which sets up for further films and has a fun nod to the mcu.

I will say Shang Chi is a great exciting addition and i found the film to be very fast moving. Action packed. And a great family conflict story that is emotionally driven.","5 out of 5 stars.

912,912,A Marvel-ous martial arts joy,"Showing no signs of slowing down hot off the heels of Black Widow, a raft of well-received Disney+ series and arriving not too far in front of the hotly anticipated The Eternals, Marvel continues to put in work that puts many other wheelhouses too shame, with the marital arts infused Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, yet another entry into the brands increasingly loaded catalogue of quality blockbuster releases.

It's hard to pinpoint exactly what Marvel keep doing to maintain the momentum that started all those years ago with 2008's Iron Man, it's absolutely correct when many say a lot of these origin stories and event pictures follow a very set formula from A to B, but with an ability to attract some of the best actors working in the industry today and handpicking a raft of some of the most exciting Hollywood filmmakers around, Marvel have once more struck gold with the incredibly fun and inventive Shang-Chi.

Quite possibly the most visually sumptuous Marvel film yet, sometimes feeling as if Marvel has meet with Ang Lee/Yimou Zhang and in my mind the Marvel film that features the best choregraphed action scenes yet from the spectacle heavy brand, Shang-Chi is a big screen blast that is freshly directed by the upcoming Destin Daniel Cretton who here has got his just rewards after his great debut Short Term 12 and the sadly undervalued The Glass Castle came before this big-budgeted ride.

Infusing his film with a great energy and charm that is enhanced by the work of leads Simu Liu (in a career launching turn) as our likable hero Shaun/Shang-Chi, Awkwafina (doing her usual but fun schtick) as Shaun's bestie Katy and Tony Leung as the unfortunate villain of the piece Xu Wenwu, Cretton has turned out to be the perfect choice to start off the cinematic journey of the fist swinging Shang-Chi and helps instill in his film some nice differences to what we've come to expect from comic book blockbusters of the modern era.

Most notably for the film is the exciting use of hand to hand combat that is delivered spectacularly in two stand out sequences on board a moving bus and then bettered alongside a high rise building in Macau, both these set pieces are easily some of the most noteworthy of any Marvel film yet while also benefiting the film other than its Asian infused eccentricities is the fun relationship between Shang-Chi and Katy than never bothers with adding extra baggage to add weight to their believable and fun friendship.

If there was a major drawback to Shang-Chi's many wins it is in an overdrawn finale, a major problem many have acknowledged previously when it comes to Marvel films, Cretton and his team can't quite stick the landing for Shang-Chi with it being a little too long in the tooth for its own good and slightly overblown and while it features some incredible imagery and technical wizardry, the films rip-roaring start and strong middle section gives way too something lesser.

Final Say -

Another huge win for Marvel who have here with the help of director Destin Daniel Cretton and his talented cast, created an instantly likable cinematic universe that provides the comic kings with one of their most unique and exciting playgrounds yet.

The movie is good and I like the casting. The direction is okay but the cinematography is the best.

The ending is anti climatic. I found it to be cliche. However it is worth the watch.

914,914,Yet another superb stand-alone superhero flick in MCEU's kitty.,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (2021) : Brief Review -

Yet another superb stand-alone superhero flick in MCEU's kitty. MCEU's new phase never looked so promising but their products are delivering Better than expected. That Spider Man flick in 2019, right after Endgame, changed many perceptions about Marvel's future and even though couple of their recent series like 'Wanda Vision' and 'Loki' couldn't emerge as clear winners, they have set a solid base for upcoming new stories. Shang-Chi is a new start by all means. Not only because it comes under new phase but mainly because it is a stand-alone film and with a new superhero who is more like using traditional combat methods along with ancient superpowers. When Captain America or Black Panther begun as Stand-alone films, they promised too much and thankfully fulfilled it. Shang-Chi does the same. It may not promise too much like Steve Rogers and Wakanda stories but the point where it ends surely gives us hints of new assembled version of superheroes in Multiverse. Shang-Chi, the master of unarmed weaponry-based Kung Fu, is forced to confront his past after being drawn into the Ten Rings organization. The film has major portion covered by Family values and hence, it may look predictable but does not bore at all. Yes, few scenes are outdated and too dramatic as if we are watching a Superhero Film made in 90s but let's just forget those weak points as Shang Chi has excelled in Visual spectacle. The screenplay could have been better in the second half when the big War was supposed to take place but it actually looks tiny one except for those two humongous dragons which might remind you of 'The Hobbit'. Performances by Simu Li, Awkwafina, Meng'er Zhang, Fala Chen, Florian Munteanu are fine according to less potential available for the roles. Actually, the humour and tone of these characters was great. They all looked normal people when they were not fighting and even though the film has ancient refrences, the character don't actually go too deep to become expressive. Director Destin Daniel Cretton seemed slightly off track in the beginning when he tries to humanise all the characters with that typically teenage humor but as the film goes ahead, he recovers from the childish entanglement. With super explosive climax he surely makes up for his mistakes, rather makes us forgive it. Overall, Shang Chi is another superb entertainer for Marvel Fanboys and even neutrals are gonna enjoy it.

RATING - 7/10*

915,915,This could've been great if it wasn't for the cheesy writing.,"The story was riddled with holes and plot issues. Since when does Awkwafina's pedestrian character all of a sudden get invited to become part of the MCU team? What's her super power... stupidity? Don't get me wrong, I love her, but her character was lazily written. Then there's the whole daddy issues dynamic - Shang is with him, then against, then with etc.. Then we have these ridiculous dragons fighting, where one scores some power crystals and becomes stronger! This is just infantile lazy writing. There was zero shock value or anything spectacular in the entire runtime, with tedious long middle acts and a bumbling third act. The jokes were cliched and not funny. The funniest parts were Ben Kingsley's character, (of whom was in this for what reasons??) and the ending to go Karaoke - which was the only time I actually cracked a chuckle. You'd think with three writers we'd have something cohesive and coherent. But instead of a Marvel superhero story, we got a Disney evil vs good with dragons thrown into the mix. It's as if they tried too hard to create the Asian version of Black Panther.

It's a shame, because the directing and cinematography were spot on, and great S/VFX - although a little overboard with the CGI i.e. Dragons. The martial arts choreography was outstanding (although again, overboard after the awesome bus scene), and the casting and performances were excellent, especially Leung, who pretty much carried the film on his shoulders. It's a 7/10 from me.","The story was riddled with holes and plot issues. Since when does Awkwafina's pedestrian character all of a sudden get invited to become part of the MCU team?

916,916,8 Rings out of 10,"For the first time in a couple of years, since 2019's ""Captain Marvel"" the MCU introduces us to a brand new hero. Simu Liu who, rather impressively, first asked for the role on Twitter brings us Shang-Chi in a film that perhaps does have some issues with it's ending, but ultimately is a fun, funny ride of the type Marvel have been perfecting for the last 13 years.

Talented, but somewhat aimless, Shaun (Simu Liu) lives in San Francisco working as a valet with his friend Katy (Awkwafina). When he's attacked on a bus, he's forced back into the world of his father, a ruthless terrorist Xu Wenwu (Tony Chiu-Wai Leung). First visiting his sister, then returning to the Ten Rings compound, Shang-Chi decides to use his skills to defend his late mothers sacred homeland against invasion from his father and for control of ten mystical arm rings, weapons that grant their owner immortality and unearthly power.

If ""Black Widow"" was considered a wobble for the MCU, despite the fact I thought that it's a perfectly fine film, then it was important to come back with something that was undeniably excellent. ""Shang-Chi"" was that. It's the perfect balance of humour and action that Marvel have established over the last few years. The action too is tweaked slightly, to more closely resemble the types of Asian led action films that we've seen previously, be that the Jackie Chan style bus fight, or the ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon""-esque flashback fight between Shang Chi's parents. There's some lovely links to the wider MCU, including a return for Benedict Wong's Wong and for Trevor Slattery, Ben Kingsley's ""Iron Man 3"" character whose masquerading role as The Mandarin was one of the MCU's most divisive moments.

It's not perfect. The ending is perhaps a little rushed and lacking a moment or two of redemption earning for Xu Wenwu, but the peaks at the future for the character, and for the 10 Rings organisation is an interesting addition, plus our first real step on what might be the route to the next big bad. Excellent stuff.","For the first time in a couple of years, since 2019's ""Captain Marvel"" the MCU introduces us to a brand new hero.

Much fighting ensues but fortunately everyone eventually learns how to 'get along' when faced with a real threat. You have seen it all before: physics-defying martial arts, monsters who look like the recently swallowed strings of LED Christmas lights, conflicted heroes with wise-cracking 'comic relief' sidekicks (an awful Aquafina and an even more awful Ben Kingsley), giant melees featuring a variety of glowing weapons (but no blood), hyper-kinetic and hyper-implausible car/motorcycle chases, and a lot of clichéd wisecracks, tough-guy dialogue, poseur slo-mo, and heroic vogueing (we're treated to the venerable three-point power landing/slide a number of times). The only novel thing the film has to offer is the excellent rendering of mythological beasts from Chinese culture; otherwise, it's an overly-long (132 minutes, which is 120 minutes too much Aquafina), derivative, repetitive, and ultimately boring entry in the bloated, jejune Micky Mouse-Marvel superhero franchise.","Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) discovers that his all-powerful and millennium-old father is about to launch an attack against the magical village where Shang-Chi's mother was born in the likely mistaken belief that his wife is not dead but is rather being held captive (there is more to the plot than one sentence can sum up but what does it matter... the story is just scaffolding for the special effects).

920,920,Promises good things for MCU's Phase Four,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings stars Simu Liu in the lead role alongside such heavy names as Tony Leung and Michelle Yeoh in this latest installment to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Liu's Shang-Chi must come to his own as the son of the legendary Mandarin (Leung), the owner of the Ten Rings.

I like this film's style most of all. Director Destin Daniel Cretton mixes Chinese wuxia settings and aesthetics with Hong Kong wire kung fu inspired action set pieces, while still keeping it feeling like a Marvel film. There's a surprising amount of callbacks and nods to the larger Marvel universe, pleasing dedicated fans, but the film is still able to stand on its own feet and introduce us to its hero.

Kudos also to the whole filming for these action scenes. Very little shaky cam or jump cuts, especially for the hand to hand scenes. Exactly as it should be. I'd dare to say that this film has some of, if not the best action set pieces in all of MCU.

One of the most thrilling and visually spectacular end battles as well, come to think of it.

Furthermore, the acting is solid, especially from Liu, Leung and Awkwafina, who plays Shang-Chi's American friend. Meng'er Zhang as Xialing, Shang-Chi's younger sister, was perhaps my only real gripe with the film. I could have used either a bit more edge to her or alternatively a lot less. Now she seemed to flipflop between relatable and aggravating.

All in all, not the best Marvel movie by any means, but that's a really high bar to clear. I can simply say that based on this, I'm very optimistic about MCU's continued future.","Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings stars Simu Liu in the lead role alongside such heavy names as Tony Leung and Michelle Yeoh in this latest installment to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Liu's Shang-Chi must come to his own as the son of the legendary Mandarin (Leung), the owner of the Ten Rings.

I like this film's style most of all. Director Destin Daniel Cretton mixes Chinese wuxia settings and aesthetics with Hong Kong wire kung fu inspired action set pieces, while still keeping it feeling like a Marvel film. There's a surprising amount of callbacks and nods to the larger Marvel universe, pleasing dedicated fans, but the film is still able to stand on its own feet and introduce us to its hero.

Kudos also to the whole filming for these action scenes. Very little shaky cam or jump cuts, especially for the hand to hand scenes. Exactly as it should be. I'd dare to say that this film has some of, if not the best action set pieces in all of MCU.

One of the most thrilling and visually spectacular end battles as well, come to think of it.

Furthermore, the acting is solid, especially from Liu, Leung and Awkwafina, who plays Shang-Chi's American friend. Meng'er Zhang as Xialing, Shang-Chi's younger sister, was perhaps my only real gripe with the film. I could have used either a bit more edge to her or alternatively a lot less. Now she seemed to flipflop between relatable and aggravating.

All in all, not the best Marvel movie by any means, but that's a really high bar to clear. I can simply say that based on this, I'm very optimistic about MCU's continued future."
921,921,The Master of kung fu was really good but not as good as I wanted it to be.,"It was better than the proceeding Marvel movie Black Window. More exceeding the expectations of a Marvel movie. Shang-Chi feels like the marvel movie experience is starting to get back to the normal of the theme ride Martian Scorsese believes they are (I can't disagree, just note that's what I want)

In comparison Shang-Chi is a lower level character. I am a fan of Marvel comics but got more of the references to the Marvel Cinematic Universe in this movie than to the direct comic book references. Those Marvel cinematic universe references were amazing enough to get over the fact that the obvious comic book ones went over my head. I mean this movie's connection to other movies is great fanfare that makes me love it more. So really cool cameos happen that actually move the story along.

I did like what they did with the Mandarin here but do feel they copied and paste a lot of things into the story of Shang-Chi to make a complete movie for a lower level character. From the little I know of the character he more fits into those Netflix's shows they did a few years back but change him enough to justify a blockbuster.

They did succeed in making Shang-Chi's background more fuller. The relationship between him and his father and sister was beautiful, complex and more importantly, never bored me and of course Awkafina as the comedy relief and best friend to Shang-Chi was strategic gold. The story for the background was not that full. It's really a character driven movie for without the amazing performances from a group of actors who know their stuff this story would fall short.

Note, I loved the fact that Michelle Yeoh was in this movie and that gives it a lot, but she's done way better in less effective films (but she most likely got a huge paycheck from Disney just to wave her hands around).

The special effects were good in this flick. I was impress with what was used to make the final conflict and I was convince that the dude from Kim's Convenience was a master of kung fu

Its a good movie but it did not live up to my high expectations of it. It gave me a lot of cool things but really did not give me anything I did not see before, in movies that did it better, but if it's about anything I did spend the rest of the day pretending I knew Kung fu.","It was better than the proceeding Marvel movie Black Window.

923,923,Finally a new kind of marvel story,,
924,924,An easy watch that fits into the MCU well,"A San Francisco valet finds his past catching up with him in spectacular fashion.

This is an entertaining superhero adventure story with an Asian martial arts theme and a number of entertaining scenes.

Like many introductions to superhero characters there is a bit of backstory to go through and this film does it with flashback sequences in a similar way to 'Black Panther'. These are mixed with the action, humour and unfolding narrative of the present day plot. Additionally there is some important exposition added relating to the Marvel multiverse. Personally I think everything depicted could have been done in more than one movie, and not so rushed, but that's just a personal preference. What is presented is not complicated in anyway, but very simplified, presumably so that it can be established quickly and the likes of Shang-Chi and Katy can share screens with other MCU characters as soon as possible.

The tone and general feel of the movie also reminds me of the approach taken with 'Black Panther', particularly when it focusses on a location that, like Wakanda, mixes the sights and sounds of regional culture with the sci-fi fantasy. It has obviously been written carefully so that it displays imagery associated with far-Eastern culture like martial arts, traditional costuming, rural settings, that is marketable to a Western audience, but at the same time it avoids other commonly associated negative stereotyping like exaggerated accents, sorcery, yellow peril, bad driving, and (thankfully) gong sounds. Much of this is drenched with a liberal amount of fast-talking contemporary American humour.

There are a number of highly enjoyable scenes such as the fight sequence on the bus, the various comedy moments, virtually everything that comes out of Ben Kingsley's mouth, and all the flashback scenes. The final dinner table scene is probably my favourite.

Visually as you can imagine it is beautiful and full of top drawer cinematography, editing, and technology-driven effects. For me though the spectacle goes over-the-top, particularly in the final action sequence.

Most actors are solid such as Simu Liu, Tony Leung, Meng'er Zhang, Michelle Yeoh, Fala Chen, and Benedict Wong. The standout performances for me easily are Nora Lum and Ben Kingsley who have buckets of charisma and the advantage of all the best lines.

Overall there is little to criticise, it just feels like what Martin Scorsese described perfectly in 2019 as a theme park rather than cinema.","A San Francisco valet finds his past catching up with him in spectacular fashion.

930,930,Marvel Sprinkles a Different Flavor into the MCU,"Marvel gets mystical in this mashup of the plucky, familiar MCU character and the more stoic, legend-heavy air of wuxia films. It's a fresh mix, effectively breaking the gravity of its more serious moments with a well-timed jape while lending credence and lore to a lesser-known corner of the comic kingdom, but these crossover moments sometimes test their limits. I could see more grounded viewers being turned off by the dragons and soul-sucking demons (far cry from the feasible reality of the first Iron Man, that) while serious fans of Chinese fantasy are bucked by the constant injection of loose wit and slappy one-liners.

When it's rolling, Shang Chi does manage to toe that line and deliver something appropriately new and versatile, a good reflection of both worlds. It benefits from a tight pair of central performances (Simu Liu and Awkwafina as a team of underachieving twenty-somethings) and several big, powerful action sets (the articulated bus fight might be one of the best combat scenes Marvel's ever put out) while tying in a dangling thread or two from earlier films to provide a sense of greater connection. On several occasions, however, it's guilty of being too self-indulgent and losing the narrative. It's great to see Ben Kingsley again, adding nuance to his part in Iron Man 3, but his scenes are the main offender here; excessive and distracting and way too cute.

The action is strong, the dialogue (mostly) works, the scenery looks great, but in the big picture, Shang Chi feels small-scale and disposable. Non-completionists won't miss anything crucial if they choose to skip it.","Marvel gets mystical in this mashup of the plucky, familiar MCU character and the more stoic, legend-heavy air of wuxia films.

933,933,Marvel movie by the numbers with beautiful dragons and charming locations,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is yet another movie inspired by the Marvel universe that has constantly been inspiring the cinematic world for more than a decade now. While the movie follows the usual stereotypes, it manages to stand out with its stunning special effects and locations.

The movie revolves around Shaun, a Chinese immigrant living in the United States of America who is working as a valet with his quirky friend and soulmate Katy. One day, they get attacked by a group of assassins on a bus and only just manage to survive. Shaun immediately understands that the attack must be related to his influential estranged father. Along with Katy, he decides to team up with his tough estranged sister Xialing to find out what's going on.

This film convinces on multiple levels. First of all, the acting performances are quite quirky and convincing. Especially the ladies steal the show. Awkwafina delivers the goods as curious, dynamic and funny woman that anyone would like to have as a friend. Zhang Meng'er on the other side represents a much darker character shaped by dramatic events from the past who is much more difficult to approach with her tough, relentless and independent personality.

The expensive special effects certainly deliver the goods as well. The scenes in a fantasy world, in Ancient China and in contemporary San Francisco are all equally stunning to watch. The fantastic creatures such as dragons look impressive on the big screen.

The story might be predictable but is nevertheless entertaining from start to finish thanks to steady pace and inspired execution. You will truly care about the fates of the different characters as you are watching this film.

However, this film isn't without its occasional flaws. First of all, lead actor Simu Liu simply doesn't have the charisma of the other actresses and actors involved. Casting him was a bold choice but it didn't fully pay off in my opinion.

Up next, the movie desperately tries to connect to other characters in the Marvel Universe. The appearance of Trevor Slattery played by Ben Kingsley is completely random as it only seems to be a pretext to offer some misplaced comic relief. The mid-credit scene starts in an amusing fashion but suddenly involving Bruce Banner and Carol Danvers only seems like a weak attempt to develop a hype for potential sequels. The same goes for yet another scene after the credits that evokes more questions rather than concluding the film appropriately.

At the end of the day, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is an entertaining fantasy action film of the Marvel Universe that should appeal to faithful and occasional fans alike. It's one of the better films in the franchise but perhaps Marvel should focus on quality over quantity instead of becoming a monstrous capitalistic machine that is scarier than any gigantic dragon shown in the film.","Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is yet another movie inspired by the Marvel universe that has constantly been inspiring the cinematic world for more than a decade now.

937,937,"A fun time at the movies, and that's all it really needed to be","Charming and incredibly fun- Shang-Chi may not be the best Marvel has had to offer- but it is one of their better films in some time. My main problems with the film lie in the films storyline, which to be honest, is really good, but incredibly all over the place editing wise and there is just so much of it that it feels like two movies could have been made out of it. I love that we get a more in depth look at our characters, their flaws, their regrets, the tragedy in their lives- but the editing makes it feel rather out of place at times- and takes away from the impact the film could have had and its heart. That being said, the film still manages to be very enjoyable throughout. The action scenes are absolutely incredible, the look of the film incredibly well developed- something very fresh and original for Marvel studios- and the cast are all a joy to watch- especially Simu Liu and Aquafina in the lead and supporting roles. I was skeptical of Aquafina being in a Marvel movie for sure, but she really helped the film as a whole, and honestly I would love to see more of her character in future Marvel projects. The film is entertaining, despite the pacing of the film being a bit all over the place at times. It has some brilliant, elaborate special effects that you will be gawking at on the screen, and plenty of surprises that will be bound to make you smile. In the end, Shang-Chi was a fun time for a Marvel movie- something most comic-book flicks have forgotten about recently- and i'm excited what this character has to offer in future films.

938,938,Shang-Chi and NOT the Ten Rings -_-,"As someone that really enjoys the MCU, I'm starting to wonder if COVID may have killed it. Black Widow was a meh experience and now Shang-Chi feels like more of that rote, by the numbers repetitiveness. Yes, they add a lot of Asian elements here to bring in other groups and try and lessen the white dominance of this franchise and I appreciate that but this movie felt like it was rushing through the plot to get to the next fantastical element and in so doing really robbed those moments of any lingering significance. Not to mention, the Marvel formula felt so very pronounced. It's so obvious what's going to happen in this movie from the jump and that's disappointing.

That aside, I'm a moderate fan of older Marvel comics and... THESE AREN'T THE TEN RINGS! Normally I don't mind when the MCU makes little adjustments to the source material. Comics are weird and a lot of that stuff wouldn't translate well to film, I get that but so far they've had two big, fat whiffs on anything Mandarin related. Looking at you Iron Man 3. These things are just super generic bands with pretty underwhelming powers which is so different from the 10 rings in the comics that all do something different!

Nerd rage aside, this just felt average to me. I'll probably check it out at some point again but I'm not feeling any sort of draw to revisit it soon. It's a touch more disappointing as I work through the Disney+ Marvel shows which all feel more engaging and more creative than this. Come on, Mouse. Get it together and put some of this TV magic back on the big screen!","As someone that really enjoys the MCU, I'm starting to wonder if COVID may have killed it.

Get it together and put some of this TV magic back on the big screen!"
939,939,Incredible MCU origin story,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is an incredible MCU origin story that's epic, emotional and extremely thrilling whilst also connecting to the greater universe in fun and satisfying ways. It's definitely the best thing in phase 4 so far even if it's third act has some of the usual MCU problems.

Simu Liu gives an incredible and extremely charismatic lead performance whilst also having superb chemistry with Awkwafina, who is also incredible. Michelle Yeoh and Meng'er Zhang are both great and Tony Leung is amazing as one of the better villains in the MCU with plenty of backstory and depth.

Destin Daniel Cretton's direction is excellent, it's extremely well filmed and stylish with some of the best action sequences in the franchise. The fight choreography is extremely impressive and the CG is mostly strong. It's well paced and both the soundtrack and the music by Joel P. West are both fantastic.","Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is an incredible MCU origin story that's epic, emotional and extremely thrilling whilst also connecting to the greater universe in fun and satisfying ways.

Great Pacing: Shang Chi has a lot of things built into the tale as it tries to make an origin story fit so far into the movie series. With all the information, there might be worry of the pace being off, but surprisingly it is done super well. Never really dragging, but not moving a blinding pace (mostly), Shang Chi's combination tales keeps things moving but not flying over the important elements to connect with characters. The cast gets ample time to give us their backstories, piece together all the cluse of this dynamic drama puzzle, and not sacrifice on the action to come.

Character Development: The trailers may have you thinking this is a modern martial arts film, and in a sense they would be right. However, the movie takes it one step further and goes beyond the punches to instead give the characters some soul and layers compared to the legendary films of the past. Shang's life is complicated and torn between light and dark, his sister as well experiencing the drama in her own manner that parallels the main protagonist. Even the antagonist has layers far beyond what we normally get from the Marvel group, and I loved how well their lines mixed together to make this melodramatic family story fit naturally into the Marvel universe.

The Surprise Cameo: Can't say much without spoiling, but if you are like me, then you will not be disappointed who shows up in the film. Several questions are answered with this character's return and with it many laughs to be had in the manner very familiar to Marvel fans. The inclusion of this character also holds an important (albeit stretch) plot element to give a little more meaning behind it, and I loved the choices they made to include him in the big picture.

The Cultural Influence: Like Black Panther and the African Culture, Shang Chi integrates so much of the cultural values of the Asian provinces into this movie. The costumes are stunning takes on the traditional attire, bringing the past to light while also sewing in some modern styles to jazz up the outfits. Concepts of family honor, the customs to practicing Marshal Arts, and the honoring of family are well-integrated into the story and help give the predictable tale some extra Kung Fu kick. The architecture of most of the setting breathes new life to the typical cityscapes that have been made famous in Marvel, and the legends of the Ten rings scream of the Asian mythology that is seeped int heir history. I loved how well these things were merged into a Marvel tale, and though again a little predictable and flaunting, really elevated the origin story to stand out from so many others.

The CGI Finally Disney has invested in making their movies show off what the studio can do. Shan Chi and the bunch have plenty of amazing things to overuse the computer effects that the modern era loves. Special effects for the action scenes has more realism to it then Black Widow executed, the creatures you will see have a lot more polish and fluidity to their movements, and the special effects involving the ten rings are fluid and holding depth that I felt has been missing in some recent Marvel projects.

The Acting: A great part played by all members on this film, extras included, Shang Chi's cast shows that acting is not dead and characters can be utilized well. Simu Liu as the lead was fantastic, and his campaign for being in this movie could not have ended up with better results. He holds much of the prodigal martial artist, disciplined and focused to be an avid fighter capable of crushing his enemies with his style. However, he also has that troubled layer in the past to watch that helped spread his emotional spectrum. Awkwafina is still the same cooky role she always plays, but this time gets a little more balance and heroism compared to the other characters she has heralded as in the past. I loved how well she was used in this film, and how great she complemented Simu in this role. Leung brings a lot of pizazz to the character, once again giving us an antagonist with so much more than the scowl and fist, and I felt was a perfect casting to play the opponent of Shang Chi. So many other great actors and actresses in this film, but due to time restrictions I have to move on, but trust me they did well in their performances.

The Comedy: Awkwafina is often used too much for making us laugh, and Disney has struggled with forcing a lot of comedy to make it kid friendly. However, Shang Chi has taken some steps back into discipline and used the comedy well to break up the ice. Dialogue goes a long way to breaking in the laughs, with well-timed jokes and gags being the solid punch to the gut with comedy. There are several ridiculous inclusions in this film that at first seem out of place, but then roll back in to be an extravagant joke that had great set up. And the throw in references that come with it and you get a shining beacon of awesomeness that comes with this movie. It's all done so well and I was very happy with the results.

The Action: My bread and butter for most of the Marvel movies, Shang Chi delivered very well on this film's action exposé. The art of choreographed battles brings another homage to Asian culture, and with it fantastic fights that had more bite and impressive skill use then half of the Marvel cinema. It's exciting, it's dynamic, and most of the fights have a different feel to them than what you might expect. Used well in the story, there is purpose behind the inclusion of the battles and each one has a different meaning and stakes behind it than simply punching and kicking. Even more so, the strategies behind them and what is required to win, accomplishes a level of storytelling that has been lost in the modern era, so well done on that too.

A Bit More Adult: The movie is definitely showing Marvel's modernization into the 21st century, and takes a risk of making this film darker and more adult than other installments. Cursing is definitely increased in this one, with plenty of swear words filling the dialogue, but not to the point of being overdone. No F bombs, but some of the language has got a little more bite, so caution. In addition, the tone of the tale is darker, and the sunshine and rainbows of Thor, Captain America, and Guardians is left in the dust for a grittier tale, which again is a plus.

Some of the political moments: While nowhere as bad as 75% of movies today, Shang Chi does sometimes get a bit preachy with the agenda politics of the film. Taking time out to rub it in our faces with an obvious line stating, ""Look what I had to do,"" was a bit of showboating that I could have done without. Yet even this dislike is marginal, given it's very little occurring, has some nice moments that build off of it, and sometimes has a fun lesson or joke built in.

A Little More Action:

The action in this movie is great, and I loved how much of it flowed and accomplished what I was expecting of the film, and things I was not expecting. Yet there were times where a moment of fighting felt a little forced, namely the chase scenes with vehicles that seemed like an afterthought. However, the fights at the end needed some more time for me, and perhaps a little more bouncing between the battles occurring at the same time. Star Wars has done this successfully in the past, showing all manners of battling and giving you a big scope of the battle. Shang Chi has done this better than several of the Marvel films, but still had some room to give us more looks at the other characters kicking butt. The battle is lengthy enough, I'll agree to that, but a little more showing off of the other warriors would have rounded this fight to perfection for me.

The VERDICT:

Shang Chi finally made me feel like we were back into the realm of Marvel I fell in love with years ago. A cultural building world with both origin and story continuation, this hero's quest had all the makings of a fun, exciting and swift adventure we were expecting. Buried beneath the amazing fights and special effects, was a deeper movie than I had expected, using their characters well and integrating them to serve a purpose. Balanced comedy with a cultural inclusion and politics did not steal away from the main theme of the movie, and giving it that adult touch was a plus in my book, though again caution with your little ones watching it. As for limitations, I agree there is predictability and familiarity with the movie, but the fresh twist and balance helps rejuvenate the formula and add minimize the impact of the limitations for me. Though I will say a little better wider scope battle is still needed by them. Overall, my scores for this film are:

Action/Adventure/Fantasy: 9.0-9.5 Movie Overall: 8.5-9.0.","Likes

943,943,Most Mystical and Beautiful Movie In History!,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is the most mystical and beautiful movie in history! The music, the special effects and the acting all take you to another world. The film leaves you wanting a Morris of your own.

The storyline follows a young man named Shang-Chi (Simu Liu). His father is a one thousand-year-old man and conqueror nicknamed The Mandarin (Tony Leung Chiu-wai), who has only ever used the infamous and all-powerful Ten Rings for evil. When the Mandarin is set to unleash infinite evil on the universe, Shang-Chi has to stop his father.

This movie is a cinematic experience. The fighting and choreography are out of this world. The long slow motion shots make the audience feel as if they are in a video game. Simu steals the show; every fight scene is flawless with his fluid movements and it proves just how hard he worked on his character for this film. Every audience falls in love with Shang-Chi; he's funny, with perfect comedic timing and he knows the balance between peace and violence. He encapsulates what the majority of young adults feel - like not being able to find their place in the world. The movie makes fans feel as if they've known Shang for years. It has wonderful flashbacks, which give the audience glimpses of his past, his pain and how his fears have shaped who he is. The film gives a wonderful all-around scope of this character that feels like a friend we've known all our life. It makes fans excited to see Shang-Chi again. Shang and his sister Xu Xialing are an iconic duo. They're both powerful and, while there's some tension due to their past, they put everything aside and let love shine through. Xialing is a role model, officially joining the Marvel Cinematic Universe's most powerful women. Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is perfect for AAPI (Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders) representation in cinema. It represents Chinese culture powerfully, shows what it's like to be an Asian-American in modern day USA, not to mention that Simu is Marvel Studios' first Asian-American superhero. Simu and Shang-Chi are writing history while also inspiring children and fans all around the world. The film delivers on all grounds; the cameos are shocking and leave you on the edge of your seat. Trying not to shout during the two post credits scenes prove to be a challenge. By the end of the movie, I wanted to sing the song ""Hotel California"" at the top of my lungs.

This film reminds you to search for who you are and let your past guide you to who you want to be. Ever since his mother died, Shang has been trained by his father to use violence. When he arrives at his mother's village, he learns how to find peace within himself and the world around him. He learns to trust himself and to use the rings for good.

I give Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 10 to 18 plus adults. It is available only in theaters September 3, 2021.

946,946,"More movies like this, please, Marvel","Thought I was feeling some Marvel fatigue after WandaVision (which started strong but ended on a bit of a whimper) and Black Widow (which wasn't terrible, but two months later I can't remember anything about it except how Florence Pugh was cool in it), but this one has rejuvenated some of my enthusiasm for the unstoppably huge MCU.

There's a satisfying origin story here, with a few small appearances from familiar characters that add spice to a host of new characters who are all quite compelling right out of the gate.

The action's great, and there's also so much of it- I liked how lots of the action felt relatively grounded by MCU standards, with neat stunt work and exciting camerawork making the action pop (it's only the final battle that gets really CGI heavy).

The humour's also more consistent than most Marvel films, with most of the jokes landing. Also cool were all the fantasy elements and creatures- they were all pretty inventive and well-executed.

I will say the one notable flaw is that there's a lot of exposition in the film's second half, but they get around that a little by having great actors like Tony Leung and Michelle Yeoh do most of the explaining (and there is a lot to explain, with this being a whole new side of the MCU and all), so it's not super noticeable.","Thought I was feeling some Marvel fatigue after WandaVision (which started strong but ended on a bit of a whimper) and Black Widow (which wasn't terrible, but two months later I can't remember anything about it except how Florence Pugh was cool in it), but this one has rejuvenated some of my enthusiasm for the unstoppably huge MCU.

Shang-Chi is another random hero that I only knew vaguely from references in the comics, but I never read any of his books back when I was a collector. I appreciated that this film brought a new style to a MCU movie. The blending of Wuxia into a superhero story was a fun choice.

There were also quite a few great actors in this film including Tony Leung, Ben Kingsley, Michelle Yeoh, and I'd even include Awkwafina in that category. I can certainly see how some other people might struggle with Awkwafina's schtick, but I find her comedic timing to be great, and I was laughing along the whole time. However, the one major name I left out of the ""great actors"" is Simu Liu. Sadly, I found him a little bland. He was okay with the comedy, but I certainly don't see him stacking up with the legends that have come before in the MCU. Heck, Benedict Wong has only about 5 minutes of screentime in this film, but still made a greater impression on me than Simu Liu.

Digging into the story of Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, I'd say it's a fine origin story, even if it was highly predictable. This is the kind of movie where you can stay 10 steps ahead of it, and that is unfortunate. I think that's the biggest problem with the entire film, while it's fun and engaging it also feels like a rough carbon copy of things that came before. It's a movie that is emulating a number of Wuxia films from the past, but it's not as good as any of them. It's a movie that is following the tropes of a superhero origin story, and once again isn't on the level of the best of the genre. You can't fault their ambition, but their execution was lacking.

All that negativity is not to say that Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is a bad film. In fact, I enjoyed the entire time in the theater, and was genuinely invested in the story. I thought it handled the links to the MCU well, but without feeling like it had shameless pandering for the fans, or devolving into obscure references only people like myself would understand. The film had some gorgeous visuals, and created its own world in a way that managed to be both unique but still consistent with the style of other MCU movies. There were personal stakes in the film, despite the fact that the ending fell into a giant CGI battle that felt unnecessary. I can't say that Shang-Chi will rise into the upper echelon of my MCU rankings, but it's better than some that came before.","As a MCU fanatic, I've been trying to get excited about the movies they have released post-Endgame, but it has been a challenge.

Sean (Shang-Chi) lives in San Francisco and parks cars for a living with his best friend Katy, whom he met when they were 14. He's happy with his life. He enjoys karaoke.

One day these bad, scary looking guys attack Sean and Katy on a bus and demand the green pendant Sean wears around his neck,,,

Oh yeah,,, Sean's real name is Shang-Chi, and his father is the leader of the TEN RINGS terrorist organization. What?!?!?!?!?!?

The visuals are incredible, and Awkwafina is hilarious!

952,952,Marvel's answer to Shonen Jump.,"Shang Chi is Marvel's latest blockbuster to grace the movies: and after 2020's non-existent Marvel slate, it was about bloody time we got something after the world dealt with the sars-variant and got our double shots. And now, late 2021 we can finally go back to the movies en masse, though the road to recovery's far from over.

Shang Chi is part-origin-story for a character we've never known before, part-CG-spectacle interlaced with nice kung-fu choreography in between, all in-universe expansion for Marvel's cinematic ambitions. And it makes you wonder how deeply they thought about paying reverence to everything from Bruce Lee to the Matrix, to Dragon Ball, The Last Airbender and Kung Fu Panda.

Marvel is doing its best to escape the confines of Iron Man's legacy, and this seems like an earnest start for something far-removed from the likes of Spider-Man, and so on. Also makes you wonder if Awkwafina is gonna become a major player outside the Shang Chi movies alone.

Shang Chi is the stuff you've come to expect from Marvel Studios; it's going big and it won't stop with every subsequent film here onward. Though bigger and better seems better fitted for high-concept space operas like Infinity War and Endgame than more earthbound character-driven stories.

Shang Chi's good fun, and it really succeeds in being that during its runtime.","Shang Chi is Marvel's latest blockbuster to grace the movies: and after 2020's non-existent Marvel slate, it was about bloody time we got something after the world dealt with the sars-variant and got our double shots.

953,953,Shang Chi,"Review By Kamal K

Marvels new Shang-Chi was a choreographed dance movie disguised as Kung fu with slow paced action scenes and subtle but detailed components that pull a story together a satisfying but inappropriately fast paced manner. Making the writing seem more lazy and poorly thought out, which for me took away greatly from that satisfaction.

The main gripe I have with Shang Chi is how it just so happens that the Jade neckaces show the path and time to the hidden forest path just days before another oath opens for them to go find the tao lao.

Although the comedy music, and some of the choreography for the fight scenes were good enough to give this movie a final score of 6 out of 10 score.","Review By Kamal K

This movie was very entertaining even if it had a pretty generic and predictable storyline, and special effects were fairly uneven (amazing 'MCU quality' along with pretty terrible early 2000s CGI).

958,958,A standalone ret-con of previous MCU mistakes.,"With the end of the Infinity Saga in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, there is a lot of room for new franchises to fill in the gaps left by the likes of Iron Man and Captain America. However, this means lesser-known properties like Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (2021) get their chance to shine. And while lesser-known franchises like Guardians of the Galaxy are now household names, I think it remains to be seen if Shang-Chi can truly develop its own integrated identity within the MCU.

Having somewhat botched the introduction of the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) in Iron Man 3 (2013), Shang-Chi attempts to ret-con this by insisting that the Ten Rings organization is a genuine threat to world peace. However, Marvel wants to have its cake and eat it too by including the ""Mandarin"" in this film. There are a few other loose connections to the larger MCU in this film, but they are more cameo call-outs than anything significant. Overall, Shang-Chi is its own story.

The fact that a good portion of this film's climax takes place in a mythical hidden kingdom made it feel disconnected from the MCU as a whole. Sure, other franchises within the MCU have their origin stories. Still, I felt they made it clear how they contributed to the ""whole"" of the larger arc by either introducing characters or concepts in prior MCU movies. Shang-Chi excels in its action and choreography but feels generic in the grand scheme of things as a standalone film. I'd almost wager that its sequel will be much more interesting and that those not already committed to the MCU can probably give this one a pass.

959,959,See Shang-Chi on the Big Screen,"The new Marvel Super Hero film, SHANG-CHI and the LEGEND OF THE TEN RINGS is the kind of film that deserves to be seen on the big screen and Writer/Director Destin Daniel Cretton (JUST MERCY) has crafted a film that earns that statement.

Based on the Marvel comic book character (of course), SHANG-CHI tells the tale of...well...Shang-Chi a financially struggling - but happy - Valet in San Francisco who has a family secret.

Writer/Director Cretton has crafted a whimsical, mythological, mystical and action packed film that settles in at the top end of the Marvel Cinematic Universe family of films.

At the center, newcomer Simu Liu (KIM'S CONVENIENCE) more than holds his own as the newest Super Hero in the MCU. He is grounded, centered and more sure than unsure as he discovers his abilities and his family's secrets. He is a worthy addition to this world of Superheroes.

Joining him is the remarkable Awkwafina (CRAZY, RICH ASIANS) as his best friend, sidekick who handles the drama comedy and action with aplomb. This film makes some smart choices with this character and Awkwafina shines.

The rest of the cast/characters are equally as strong from Tony Chi-Wai Leung (as Shang-Chi's father) to Meng'er Zhang (as Shang-Chi's sister) and good ol' Michelle Yeoh (as Shang-Chi's Aunt) bring strong characters to life. They all shine.

This film also brings back a character from a previous MCU film that somewhat redeems the poorly conceived character from his earlier appearance. I won't spoil it by saying who it is, but I liked what the MCU did with this character.

But, this being a Marvel movie, all of these performances anchor a bigger picture that is filled with action, action and more action - and something else, something mystical.

Here is where Director Cretton really shines. The action scenes are interestingly staged and choreographed well. The first fight (the bus fight that is shown in the trailer) and a fight on scaffolding both particularly work well.

This film does delve into the mystical in the last 1/3 and in Cretton's hands, this ends up working well instead of being comical or inane. I bought what was going on and was rooting for our heroes to defeat the undefeatable, fantastical creatures.

To be honest, the ""final battle"" didn't really live up to the rest of the film so that brings this film down a notch, but this movie did what it needed it to do, it opened up a whole new area of the Marvel Cinematic Universe - in both character and locations - and I am anxious to see where they go from here.

Try to see SHANG-CHI on the Big Screen, the visuals are worth it.

967,967,Ten Rings to rule them all...,"Positives:
This is Marvel at its best. A script (with Shakespearean undertones) that melds action with good character development and laugh-out-loud feelgood dialogue. The great thing is that you don't need to be a Marvel nerd to enjoy this one. Yes, there are some fabulous Easter Eggs for Marvel fans (and a wonderful return of a character from one of the early films). But its almost a standalone feature in its own right.


The action sequences are top-notch, particularly an early fight on a careering an Francisco ""bendy-bus"". Some great martial arts reminiscent of ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", made more exciting by the fact that the impressive Simu Liu did all his own stunts.






Negatives:






Timeline?: So, it took more of a Marvel nerd than I am (my wonderful daughter-in-law Bronwyn) to point out that although this film is set (largely) in the ""Present Day"", the events of ""Avengers: Endgame"" actually happen in 2023. So in the Marvel timeline, this is set in between Thanos's ""blip"" and ""the return"". This is the reason why Wong is present but not Doctor Strange, for example.

Summary Thoughts: Marvel goes East! This is a really entertaining addition to the franchise, mixing Marvel action with Eastern mysticism and martial arts. It's an impressive job by director and co-writer Destin Daniel Cretton, in only his second feature (he did ""Just Mercy"" in 2019).

As a Marvel film, there are of course end-credit scenes (""monkeys"" in onemannsmovies speak). A mid-title one is the best, bringing some additional Marvel characters into the mix. And there's a post-credits one which sets up for further sequels but which I found rather irritating.

It's ironic that a Marvel movie so right for the Chinese market - the first to be headlined by an Asian actor and with substantial Mandarin dialogue - might not get a release in China. According to this report, this appears to be for two reasons: firstly that the actor Simu Liu made some derogatory remarks about China in the past, and secondly that in the comics Shang Chi's father is Fu Manchu - a Western-derived character with racial overtones.

This doesn't seem to have hurt it so far. After less than two weeks of opening, it has made $262 million on a budget estimated to be $150-200 million.

This is Marvel at its best. A script (with Shakespearean undertones) that melds action with good character development and laugh-out-loud feelgood dialogue. The great thing is that you don't need to be a Marvel nerd to enjoy this one. Yes, there are some fabulous Easter Eggs for Marvel fans (and a wonderful return of a character from one of the early films). But its almost a standalone feature in its own right.


The action sequences are top-notch, particularly an early fight on a careering an Francisco ""bendy-bus"". Some great martial arts reminiscent of ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", made more exciting by the fact that the impressive Simu Liu did all his own stunts.

971,971,One of the most Emotionally Charged Superhero Movies made in recent times.,"Let's keep aside all these serious conversations about Asian Representation, Diversity and all other societal stuff for a moment and let us all just appreciate Marvel for creating one of the most (if not the Most) emotionally charged superhero movies in recent times.

I'm not even exaggerating, I have been a follower of Marvel since my teenage days, suffice it to say, Through many ups and downs I keenly witnessed all of their works over the years. Trust me when I say that they have very much revamped their strategy this time around.

Excluding their typical set-up for a Comicbook blockbuster, Shang-Chi's familial/dramatic aspects are on an all-time high here. The way this story has been told, it just feels somewhat distinctive and special (Especially, compared to the last few projects Marvel has had come up with).

Other than the apparent masteries in its Audio-Visual departments (as expected); the narrative here infuses a powerful statement, a different outlook on family & self-acceptance. And guess what? It never sounded preachy nor pretentious; not for a single moment.

Another praiseworthy characteristic is the Action sequences or to be precise, all the Choreography behind! An incredible show for the Martial Arts fans and yeah FYI Simu Liu (Shang-Chi); our primary protagonist did most of his stunts, all by himself; that is amazing Isn't it?

Pretty much the same impression applies to all the other members of the ensemble; however, I do have some serious reservations about their respective character depictions.

To start with, Shang-Chi's estranged father (Played by a veteran, Tony Leung Chiu-wai); The writing on his character felt a bit detached and incoherent! Don't know about you, but for the most part, I was rather uncertain about what should I exactly feel about this guy! Should I be sympathetic or furious about the choices he had made? Gotta say this dilemma got the better of me.

Furthermore, the Mother of Shang-Chi (Played by Fala Chen) from Ta-Lo; I do feel her screentime in here should have been elongated a little bit more! Just so the viewers could grasp her part of the storyline too! Other than that, she, herself was pretty great in there. No complaints whatsoever. And Oh yeah, Nora Lum or Awkwafina (The Name, majority of you might know her by). She was terrific in her role as well; the much-needed comic relief in such a sob story!

In a nutshell, I must admit, this was a rather unprecedented gamble from Marvel and It did pay off quite well in the end. To be honest, I couldn't be more pleased about that! As I see it, these Superhero films tend to get repetitious over the years so it's always like a breath of fresh air whenever there is a drastic transition coming straight from the creators, and when it gets backed up by the Big Studios themselves; well that's your cherry on top.","Let's keep aside all these serious conversations about Asian Representation, Diversity and all other societal stuff for a moment and let us all just appreciate Marvel for creating one of the most (if not the Most) emotionally charged superhero movies in recent times.

972,972,What a pleasant surprise this was!,"Visually a perfect film for me watching a film in theatre after 20 months. Going in I expected marvel to half-ass the genre but still make it entertaining like a number of their other films. But I was taken aback wonderfully right from the beginning with the opening narration completely in Chinese. What I saw then was a proper modern wuxia fantasy which with some changes could've fooled me for a Chinese production (maybe I'm being a bit hyperbolic).

As fitting to a wuxia film, the lust for power, the love that conquers evil and the despair of lost love are all seen in this film. And who best to bring all those than the legendary Tony Leung who was the face of Hong Kong cinema through In The Mood For Love and acted in some of the best Wuxia films. He was definitely the best thing about the film. I was half expecting Marvel to mess it up like they use great actors for villains all the time. But he was the first main character to appear and even till the end his presence was felt.

This also has some of the best hand to hand action sequences in the MCU easily. The martial arts action, even when the superpowers are included also makes the action just beautiful which is something I feel the first time in an MCU film.

Awkwafina was quirky but what I liked there was that they kept it platonic and didn't jump into anything at any point. Maybe they'd do that in the future but at least they didn't break the flow in the relationship. Meng'er Zhang and Fala Chen also made their presence felt, as badass fighters. And Michelle Yeoh as expected of her came in and owned the screen when she was present.

I'm really surprised at how much I liked the film. The final fight sequences that rose to the most epic Chinese fantasy fight you can think of is the only thing I was expecting them to not mess up. Maybe it is because of my low expectations on how Marvel deals with the genre and the villain that made me love this so much.","Visually a perfect film for me watching a film in theatre after 20 months.

973,973,A Very Fresh MCU Entry,"When Iron Man hit theatres back in 2008, there were rumblings about a cinematic universe starting, but obviously, nobody expected that we would make it to a film like Avengers: Endgame at the time. Along the way, unknown properties like Guardians of the Galaxy and Ant-Man came out of nowhere as well but were welcomed with open arms. I was really hoping that Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings would follow in those footsteps, and it more than does. With rich world-building, a great cast, and the use of mythology, this is one of my favourite Marvel Cinematic Universe entries to date. Over time I may even come to appreciate it even more. After a first viewing, here's why Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings deserves to be seen on the big screen (if you can).

After being trained as an assassin by his father, Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) is given ten years of freedom from this life. In the present, the film picks up with Shang-Chi (Shaun) as he is living a normal life in San Francisco with his friend Katy (Awkwafina). When the history/mythology of the so-called Ten Rings is brought back into the forefront, his mission is to go and find his father. With the help of his friend and sister, they return home to face the music and it may just end up being father vs son to save this world. From start to finish, this film delves into the fun, the mythological, the family drama, and some incredible martial arts in order to tell this very solid story.

Aside from the fact that newcomer Simu Liu is undeniably charming and very likeable in this role, it's the unique style of the movie that made it stand out from the rest of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Yes, it still has the same look and feel, especially when it comes to aesthetics and comedic relief, but the rest of the film had its own distinct heartbeat. Bringing martial arts into this franchise just felt like a breath of fresh air to me. Not only does it feel simultaneous that they're trying to have fun and pay homage to classic films of this nature, but the fact that martial arts, mixed with actual god-like powers just felt so earned by the climax of the film. Without giving anything away, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is far more magical and mystical than I was expecting, but I kind of loved the finale when looking back on it.

There's really not much about this film that I feel compelled to complain about, but I will say that with as much drama that this film has and with how much it does dive into mythology, sometimes the comedy felt out of place. Awkwafina as Katy was great and I think her chemistry with Simu Liu was great as well, but I think certain cuts to her one-liners felt a little unnecessary for the specific situation. There are a few scenes where moments deserve our full attention, but the film felt the need to cut away to something funnier. Aside from the humour taking me out a few times, this film is just a blast.

Overall, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Tens Rings is easily at the top of the origin films that this franchise has given us and probably one of my favourite entries as a whole. Director Destin Daniel Cretton (Short Term 12, Just Mercy) has done a great job here and the cinematography by Bill Pope (The Matrix, Baby Driver) was also a real standout. I thought the scope of the movie felt very grand and that's absolutely in part to how it was filmed. I almost thought the finale of the movie was going to be a huge negative, but again, after thinking about the movie again, there is a nice progression in the story that makes the climax feel earned, even if a tad overblown. If you're a fan of this franchise, this one is a must-see, but even if you're not, this one can stand on its own as well, having only a few acknowledgements to previous films.

Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is now playing exclusively in theatres and if you're able to go in your area, I highly recommend it.","When Iron Man hit theatres back in 2008, there were rumblings about a cinematic universe starting, but obviously, nobody expected that we would make it to a film like Avengers: Endgame at the time.

974,974,Good,"One of the best origin MCU films. Good story, great and complex family relationships, with it's own identity, a very good balance between action and comedy and really good fight scenes. Between Simu Liu, Awkwafina and Tony Leung it's difficult to decide which was the best, but the acting was really strong all around (also a mention to Ben Kingsley, always funny!). The best thing I can say about it is that for most of it's duration it didn't even feel like an MCU film.

The negatives? Again, too much CGI. It's a huge problem with Marvel and Disney as they use the green screen in almost every scene. I like CGI but seriously, some scenes would look much better with practical effects, others would look way better if they just were shot at location.","One of the best origin MCU films.

979,979,A miss in the MCU.,"Hollywood trying to be too woke about being Chinese.

Always hate it when they make a villain not really a villain as to not offend anyone. Shang Chi's father is supposed to be a pure villain, the mother storyline took away a lot from the real storyline.

Awkwafina's character becoming a boss archer after one day of training was equally ridiculous.

Hopefully if a sequel is made it will be darker, though I'll admit the Mandarin was a funny touch.","Hollywood trying to be too woke about being Chinese.

980,980,A Great Origin Film,"The next instalment of the MCU, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings has come out and I managed to see it the other day and I have finally found time to review it and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees a young martial artist forced to face his past when his criminal father comes hunting for him.

Main Character Relative unknown Simu Liu plays Shang-Chi and he is really good in this role. He really delivers a strong performance and you will come out of the film really liking him and caring about the character of Shang-Chi. The focus on his family dynamic is really well done and Liu does a great job in selling that and showing the pain that he has been through in his life and bringing this great hero to life. He is also fantastic in the action scenes and that is a huge part of this film and you have to believe in the heroes capabilities and I really did.

Supporting Characters Awkwafina plays his best friend Katy and I feel like this character is really going to split opinion, some will hate her, some will love her. I pretty much hit both ends of the spectrum, I thought she was really annoying in the first act of the film and it hurt my enjoyment, but as she had her role slightly lessened she became much more likeable and her character arc became very clear. Tony Leung plays his first role in an American film playing Wenwu and this is one of the best antagonists in the current MCU. I loved this character and performance, he isn't just some generic bad guy and at times I really understood his motivations and saw the emotion from his performance and it was really strong. Meng'er Zhang plays Xialing and I liked her character here and I thought it really complemented Shang-Chi really well. There is clearly issues there and the film plays it up well, and makes her more then just this female sidekick and she is given a personality.

Story The story is at its strongest when it focuses on the family issues between the characters, in particular Shang-Chi and Wenwu. That father and son dynamic is great and both actors deliver really well in their roles and it makes there clashes feel even more important as you genuinely care about both of them in the film. The issue is that the film kind of strays away from that and tries to focus on too much. It has plenty of exposition scenes and fits so much in that it distracts from the main thing that makes this film great. The final act puts the focus in the wrong place, its hard to explain without spoilers but I think you will know what I mean if you watch the film.

Script The script is okay, the drama is really well done and made me care about these characters and the emotional predicaments that they are put in during this adventure and I actually think this film is held back a little bit by the fact that it is in the MCU. What I mean by that is that it has the humour you come to expect from the universe is here but it is done poorly and I never really laughed at all and that was a disappointment.

Style The film looks fantastic, the CGI is all beautiful and I think it does an excellent job of building this world of Martial arts that is very different to other elements of the MCU. The fight scenes live up to the hype and are the best that have been seen in The Marvel Cinematic Universe, the flow so well and are so hard hitting that it is easily the best element of the film.

Overall Overall, Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings is a great film and another solid addition to The Marvel Cinematic Universe. It isn't top tier Marvel but does a great job of introducing a new hero in Shang-Chi.

Rating - 8/10.","The next instalment of the MCU, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings has come out and I managed to see it the other day and I have finally found time to review it and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees a young martial artist forced to face his past when his criminal father comes hunting for him.

Main Character Relative unknown Simu Liu plays Shang-Chi and he is really good in this role. He really delivers a strong performance and you will come out of the film really liking him and caring about the character of Shang-Chi. The focus on his family dynamic is really well done and Liu does a great job in selling that and showing the pain that he has been through in his life and bringing this great hero to life. He is also fantastic in the action scenes and that is a huge part of this film and you have to believe in the heroes capabilities and I really did.

Supporting Characters Awkwafina plays his best friend Katy and I feel like this character is really going to split opinion, some will hate her, some will love her. I pretty much hit both ends of the spectrum, I thought she was really annoying in the first act of the film and it hurt my enjoyment, but as she had her role slightly lessened she became much more likeable and her character arc became very clear. Tony Leung plays his first role in an American film playing Wenwu and this is one of the best antagonists in the current MCU. I loved this character and performance, he isn't just some generic bad guy and at times I really understood his motivations and saw the emotion from his performance and it was really strong. Meng'er Zhang plays Xialing and I liked her character here and I thought it really complemented Shang-Chi really well. There is clearly issues there and the film plays it up well, and makes her more then just this female sidekick and she is given a personality.

Story The story is at its strongest when it focuses on the family issues between the characters, in particular Shang-Chi and Wenwu. That father and son dynamic is great and both actors deliver really well in their roles and it makes there clashes feel even more important as you genuinely care about both of them in the film. The issue is that the film kind of strays away from that and tries to focus on too much. It has plenty of exposition scenes and fits so much in that it distracts from the main thing that makes this film great. The final act puts the focus in the wrong place, its hard to explain without spoilers but I think you will know what I mean if you watch the film.

981,981,A wonderful addition to the MCU!,"Shang-Chi is one of those Marvel films that feels like the full package. It has lots of brilliant trademark MCU humour and tongue in cheek quips. It has exceptional action which I'll get into a bit more. It also has solid connections to the rest of the MCU, balanced well between being its own stand alone film but laying hints of how this is going to fit into the wider story of Phase 4.

I'll start with the action as this is what Shang-Chi is famed for. Quite simply it's awesome. It has the best hand to hand combat the MCU has seen, and sequences that are steeped in Chinese culture, with the rhythmic style of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon woven into the fabric of this film.

The cast was brilliant. Simu Liu was a fantastic lead, and I'd be happy to see him grow into a big player in the MCU. Awkwafina as expected was fantastic, adding so much effortless humour to the film.

What I really love about Shang-Chi is that it has a very well explored and interesting antagonist. This can't always be said for Marvel films as there have been a few phoned in villains, but Shang-Chi doesn't come close to falling into this trap. Tony Leung really sold his role and gave it a lot of power and emotion.

In terms of plot they did a fantastic job of introducing us to this pretty obscure character. There is a lot of exposition and plenty of flashbacks, perhaps too many but I appreciate they had a lot of background content to feed us so I can't grumble too much. I loved how the plot was so mystical and magical, very much feeling like an epic adventure.

Yet again Marvel Studios knocking it out of the park!","Shang-Chi is one of those Marvel films that feels like the full package.

982,982,nothing out of this world but a lot better then i expected,,
983,983,Showcases the possibilities of Phase 4,"This was the right direction for Marvel to head post-Endgame. Finding new stories to tell within cultures rarely explored is the way for the MCU to continue to entertain.

The fights in the first third of this movie were absolutely brutal and quite innovative. I wish they hadn't front-loaded all of this stunning choreography since the fights later on paled in comparison. This film also contains arguably the most beautiful and artful scene in the MCU with the Crouching Tiger-inspired hidden garden duel. There was a sense of more indie-based filmmaking and I really enjoyed that fresh take on the genre. I would be remiss not to mention Tony Leung, who perfectly brings to life one of the finest villains in the MCU. His character has a lot of depth and is one you can truly empathize with.

While there are still the tropes expected in a Marvel origin film, it succeeds pretty well for the most part. I wish the big CGI battle at the end had just been a personal fight between father and son, but alas. The humor, especially Awkwafina, was pretty hit or miss as well. The Trevor Slattery stuff was great though.

Shang-Chi is definitely one of the best origin films in the MCU and really stands out as a unique entry in the long-running series.","This was the right direction for Marvel to head post-Endgame.

984,984,Really good blend of martial arts and MCU formula,"The bus fight scene is one of the best action scenes of the entire MCU. Just for that scene alone, this movie deserves to be watched on the biggest screen possible. Shang Chi benefited from being a very unknown character and the movie gives him the opportunity to shine bright with his development. The story is really fast paced and even if the final act succumbs to the typical Marvel esque, it leaves you with a pretty solid good feeling while leaving the cinema. A really great MCU movie, a superb martial arts spectacle and a great step up for the Phase 4. Do not miss the two post credits scenes. The middle scene is exciting and the very last one is pretty intriguing. Bring it on, Marvel!","The bus fight scene is one of the best action scenes of the entire MCU.

985,985,The birth of a new legend,"The birth of a new Marvel Hero. And a very successful one. One of the better Marvel adaptations of the recent years and the perfect introduction of this new hero.

Its packed with amazing action, a great legacy and a wisely picked cast who get the chance to portray fun characters.

To start with Simu Liu who shoots himself to stardom with this film. His portrayal was fun as he perfectly mixes the hero attitude with a nice tongue-in-cheek humor and perfectly develops himself without taking all of it too seriously. Same goes to his co-star Awkwafina who was perfectly cast. Having Tony Leung as the to center-part was an excellent creative decision. Then the film has some fan favorites appearing as Ben Kingsley's Trevor or Benedict Wong who round it up to a wonderful Marvel adventure, just as you would expect.

The action scenes are tremendous, as the film is filled with great Martial Arts sequences, (of course Michelle Yeoh is not to be missed here). The bus scene at the beginning is a true stand out action scene in the entire Marvel universe.

Really a good one for the next phase of Marvel, and I like how it links to the whole universe just perfectly. Another Marvel winner.","The birth of a new Marvel Hero. And a very successful one. One of the better Marvel adaptations of the recent years and the perfect introduction of this new hero.

986,986,Elevates itself above the typical superhero origin story by incorporating many fantastic elements from Asian culture,"""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" is the second film in Phase Four of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Starring Simu Liu, Tony Leung, and Awkwafina, it elevates itself above the typical superhero origin story by incorporating many fantastic elements from Asian culture.

In San Francisco, Shaun (Simu Liu) works as a parking valet along with his close friend Katy (Awkwafina). Unbeknownst to Katy, Shaun is hiding important secrets from her - he is in fact a skilled martial artist whose real name is Shang-Chi and he has run away from his father Xu Wenwu (Tony Leung), the leader of the powerful Ten Rings organisation. After some Ten Rings members attack the pair of them on a bus, Shang-Chi discovers that they have stolen a valuable pendant given to him by his mother Li (Fala Chen) before he left for the United States. Shang-Chi grows concerned that the Ten Rings' next target will be the pendant belonging to his younger sister Xialing (Meng'er Zhang), and so along with Katy he sets off to look for her before the gang can locate her first.

Now that the Infinity Saga has concluded, the time has come for some new heroes to enter the MCU. Of course, there are so many to choose from, considering the large roster of characters that have come into existence over the last several decades. Although Shang-Chi wasn't the first one to come to my mind when predicting who would lead the charge of fresh faces into Phase Four, his debut big screen outing ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" successfully cements him as a memorable hero just as worthy as any other past Avenger.

What I believe separates this film from the typical hero origin story is all of the interesting aspects of Asian culture it integrates into the story. I'm all for inclusivity in movies, so long as it isn't shoehorned in there for the sake of appeasing a political agenda, and here it succeeds greatly thanks to the wide array of Asian crew members who worked hard to ensure that virtually all customs are represented. The film never precisely establishes the place Shang-Chi's family is from (though it is hinted to be somewhere in mainland China), as they are seen observing various cultural traditions that don't quite narrow things down to one particular Asian country. For example, there are martial artists resembling Shaolin monks, who are supposed to be from China, seen using techniques from Japanese and Korean folklore. This has likely been done on purpose to ensure that all Asian audiences feel included, but never so much that it comes across as disrespectful. After previously bungling Asian-related matters with the terrible 2020 remake of ""Mulan"", ""Shang-Chi"" feels like an appropriate apology from Disney to all of their viewers.

At this stage, it feels pointless to complain about Marvel films following the exact same template when introducing new heroes so I won't hold that against this one too much. With that said, thanks to some brilliantly choreographed martial arts fight scenes and gorgeous visuals, director Destin Daniel Cretton (""Just Mercy"") has provided us with one of the most unique looking MCU films to date. One scene near the beginning features Xu Wenwu walking through a bright, beautiful oriental garden complete with bamboo reeds in the foreground. A short time later, he is locked in hand-to-hand combat with his future love interest Li. This reminded me of ""wuxia"" films, a popular subgenre of Chinese martial arts movies, like ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"". In fact, this scene was such a good tribute to that genre that I almost forgot this was a Marvel movie and was instead watching one of those classic Kung Fu films my dad used to show me when I was young. You know you've created something special when your film can appeal this effectively to fans of both Marvel and Kung Fu movies.

Considering the last thing I saw him in was the sitcom ""Kim's Convenience"", Simu Liu definitely took me by surprise as to how well cast he was as the film's main star. I was expecting him to be a wisecracking Americanised version of the Asian hero but he actually plays most of the film straight, only responding humorously when absolutely necessary. His dramatic side truly shines when he is interacting with his onscreen father Tony Leung. In fact, Leung's character Xu has one of the most tragic backstories of any character in the whole MCU, which I won't spoil here. Another surprise was Awkwafina as Shang-Chi's best friend Katy. Rather than being another typical love interest, Katy is instead a loyal platonic friend of his who is willing to help him out no matter how limited her knowledge on the field of battle may be. It also helps that she is responsible for most of the film's comic relief.

With a new superhero now officially introduced, it's safe to assume that ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" has shown an optimistic future for the MCU. Its broad appeal to Eastern and Western audiences alike as well as the usual action-packed fun we've come to expect over the years makes it one of the best origin films to come out of the MCU to date. The Marvel hype train shows no signs of slowing down and if things keep going the way they are, it won't be stopping anytime soon.

989,989,"It's very pretty, but the story/plot is mediocre and filled with holes","As far as visuals go, this movie is amazing... like just about as impressive as Dune, it's filled to the brim with eye-candy.

The plot/story however is mediocre and filled with plot holes... the characters' actions are often unrealistic and they will often just 'stare in awe' at their friends being killed, instead of doing the realistic thing, and immediately defending their friends... it's something that happens like 5 times and honestly spoils the movie for me.... if characters in a movie don't act or react realistically and stare at something like a braindead zombie (like their friends getting killed right in front of them, whilst they are holding a gun in their freeking hands), then it's just really terrible script/plot writing.

Overall, the movie isn't as bad as Ant-Man 2 but it's not far behind. Also, Awkwafina's acting style was already old by the 2nd movie she did... ALL of her characters in movies are the same person, and like I said, it got boring after the 2nd movie. I roll my eyes at everything Awkwafina's character does in the movie.

It's a 5/10 movie, not really worth a watch unless you're a real die-hard Marvel fan.","As far as visuals go, this movie is amazing... like just about as impressive as Dune, it's filled to the brim with eye-candy.

990,990,There's Dragon Fights!,"What more do you want?

I honestly didn't want to like this film. As you may have read in previous reviews of the Marvel films, they are all dumb. And this one ends as they all do, with just massive CGI chaos. But did I mention they were dragons fighting?

Anyway, the film is fun. Fun and lively in the sense of watching a water painting come to life. The fight sequences are laborious...sometimes. Since being rocked with energy source that could topple buildings doesn't even crack a rib seems silly.

But Shang-Chi makes it work. Here played by the moon-faced wide-eyed and fun loving Simu Liu. And he does a wonderful job NOT wanting to be anything but a typical slacker. While he carries the burden of a darker past..haunted, even...he does his best to make the best of his situation with his San Fran pal Katy. Now usually Awkwafina irritates me to no end. Here, she is much more subdued and is truly a ""bro"" any guy would want in a sisterly form/love interest. The balance of her hip banter to seriousness is flawless. And quite the joy when not on screen.

Big kudos to Tony Leung. Who has spent generations emoting with the most efficient use of words. He doesn't require much and carries a lot. He plays a former evil doer whose only motivation is love.

His fatherly love for his children is only surpassed by regaining a love he's lost. And truly embodies that person who cannot let it go. But that credit goes to Li, played by Fala Chen. A gentle soul in what can be described as Shangri-La. I could watch her do kata for hours. Her gracefulness would make any man want to open the gates of Hell for.

Much praise goes to director Destin Cretton for balancing spirituality with family ties. This is a very difficult line to tow while trying not to be overbearing. He was smart enough to know that the family dynamics of an Asian household have small passive-aggressive moments that pick at the main characters. But doesn't ever go past the ""you must have honor"" trope that infects a movie like ""Mulan""","What more do you want?

992,992,An Asian Marvel Origin story with all the spectacle you've come to expect.,"Another great and entertaining experience which is very similar to what has gone before in format, but the formula works very well and I enjoyed the film a lot. The Asian style and presentation is beautiful, showing off plenty of folklore and style in both modern and traditional settings. The presentation is very stylish, the special effects were superb and the martial arts fight scenes were fast and exciting The plot is good, focusing on the human and family side of the characters rather than the magical, and sets up a good intrigue for the continuation of the MCU. The acting is good and although the comic relief and cute character did change things up, they also spoiled it a bit and made the slow middle section drag on even more. The ending was pretty grand and epic, but I felt it could have been better.","Another great and entertaining experience which is very similar to what has gone before in format, but the formula works very well and I enjoyed the film a lot.

994,994,Unique. But a very fun film,"I have to say I was looking forward to this one. First film in a while that had no connection to avengers etc so I was intrigued to see how they would do this. And on the whole it was very enjoyable and fun to watch!

First instincts when watching were a little mixed. It was an odd start to say the least and didn't have any idea how this was going to go. And my first instincts on Katy were also mixed. I felt like they were trying to force the humour out on her and I found her character really annoying. HOWEVER..

Once it gets going the film gets better and better. Katy becomes a great character and all the characters development and arcs on a whole were truly phenomenal! For me the best part of the film was the characters and seeing them all develop throughout.

So is the plot good? To be blunt, yes! It's truly unique and uniquely done in so many ways, I don't want to give out anything that would spoil anything, but it's really not what you expect. That's all I say!



I'll shut up now! I'll just say it's well worth watching. It's a great ""superhero"" to have and a great one to watch. And overall it's a fun, visually pleasing and brilliant watch. I recommend.","I have to say I was looking forward to this one. First film in a while that had no connection to avengers etc so I was intrigued to see how they would do this.

997,997,Really enjoyable film 7/10,"Shang - Chi is the new hero of the MCU and everyone is going to love him. Although I have a really deep criticism over fase 4 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I've decided to go watch the movie in theaters (after two years of being away from theaters due to covid). Overall I really enjoyed it. There were still a few moments that I regretted and that were dull. Not to mention ""little mistakes"" that Marvel keep doing with their movies. In general it was a fun experience. The plot didn't have much to offer to be honest: another origin story of a superhero that tries to run away from his fate and responsibilities. Until he is forced to face his past.

This has been the kind of way for Marvel to introduce their new characters in the MCU, I wished they would have been more creative but they do deliver creativity for once. Watching people speak their native language for once was a huge step up for Marvel. The movie is also influenced by many other asian classic films such as ""Hero"", ""Hidden Dragon"", ""Seven Samurai"" and ""In the mood for love"".

Of course it wouldn't be a Marvel movie without some end credits scenes (how original). The end credit scene does confirm the return of Shang Chi at some point, but what the end credits scene does confirm moreover is how the future Marvel films will all get connected. As I said before, I'm less optimistic with this whole fase 4 of Marvel but it wouldn't hurt or kill to watch a few of them. To me, I just wanted to return to the theaters.

Speaking of actors: Simu Liu is a fantastic actor and will definitely become a fan favorite, both him and his character. Awkwafina steals the show every single time she's on screen. Tony Leung is wonderful and acts so well. The whole cast is perfect. If you are in favor of theaters and Marvel movies than go watch Shang Chi.

P. S: the end credit song - Fire in the Sky by Anderson Paak. Is the best part of the movie.","Shang - Chi is the new hero of the MCU and everyone is going to love him.

998,998,Shang-chi and the legend of the ten rings,"I have just watched this movie. I am an avid Marvel fan. This film introduces a new character, there is that standard Disney approach, with a mix of comedy, seriousness and lots of action.

Disney work through the numbers on this film, there are no surprises and it does what it does on the tin.

The acting is good, special effects are solids and the story is not bad.

There's continuity linking to the other marvel universe which is nice for the fans.

I would actually pitch this at 7.5/10, not quite an 8 but higher than a 7

Those review of 1 or 2 out of ten are way off the mark, this film is not that bad.","I have just watched this movie. I am an avid Marvel fan. This film introduces a new character, there is that standard Disney approach, with a mix of comedy, seriousness and lots of action.

1001,1001,Awesome.,"Best fight scenes since the civil war airport scene. They mess up simply by trying to make the character 10 years younger then the actor is. But aside from that I thought it was awesome. Plenty of cool action fight scenes, goes a little off the rails at the end with way too much cgi for what was a relatively grounded movie to start. Great addition to MCU , especially after the quality level the shows have been.","Best fight scenes since the civil war airport scene.

1003,1003,Refreshing and Captivating!,"""I gave you ten years to live your life. And where did that get you? You walked in my shadow.""

Marvel Studios' Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings follows Shang-Chi, a seemingly ordinary young man from San Francisco who parks cars for a living alongside his friend, as must confront the past he thought he left behind when he is drawn into the web of the mysterious Ten Rings organization. Marvel took a big chance on this project. Of course we've had lesser known heroes end up getting their own movie franchise within the MCU, but Shang-Chi is not one many know about. Little was known going in other than we'd get some action scenes and explore new territory within the MCU. What they managed to do with Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings is unlike any Marvel movie yet. Destin Daniel Cretton takes a new approach that works wonders. His previous works of Short Term 12 and Just Mercy are heartfelt dramas so something big like this is new territory, but he incorporates the same style and messages into this. The dysfunctional family dynamic serving as the character arc and forming the conflict is so much deeper than some random business guy who wants to rule the world. With this story, it's easy to connect with it and understand character motives. I will say there's a lot to pack in here and the story can get muddy at points, but it pulls itself together that we retain most of everything.

Simu Liu is fantastic in the title role. Previous to watching, I hadn't seen him in anything. But he has all the skills as an emerging actor to be a household name. Shang-Chi is an interesting character to follow. As he discovers and recalls moments from his upbringing, we can slowly piece him together. There's much more to be made from him, but with future installments we'll be able to get much more. And Tony Chiu-Wai Leung is perfectly cast as Xu Wenwu. He's a villain I can understand, like, and dislike all at the same time. He's flawed, but there's depth to him. And he almost steals the show by the end with another showcase of mad acting skills. But the character I've been thinking of a lot, and mainly because she was so hilarious, is Awkwafina as Katy. Awkwafina is one of my favorite actresses working right now, especially after her role in The Farewell, and she smashes this. Katy is the typical comedic sidekick but so much fun. One of the funniest jokes comes from her and I was laughing hysterically. Maybe more character will come from her later, but what we got was enough for me. I can't wait to see her again! I should also mention Meng'er Zhang as Xialing. This is her first role and she's also great. What they'll do with her next should be interesting.

From a technical standpoint, this is impressive for a Marvel movie. There are some stunning visuals. The cinematography isn't that gray color scheme used in most, though it does fall into that later on, and bursting with color. And as you probably know, the visual effects are as good as they come. It's not muddled with CGI and a scene that was completely green screen, which is nice to see. Also, Marvel has been doing great with the themes and score lately because this is another great one, along with the soundtrack. Paired with this are the best fight scenes out of the whole MCU. The stunt choreography is top notch and is beautiful and intense to look at. The bus scene early on is the best yet and will be hard to top! Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings just really did it for me and most everybody can agree. It's refreshing and captivating in every way. Marvel has been taking some big leaps with this new phase and it gets me more and more excited for each new installment!","""I gave you ten years to live your life. And where did that get you?

1007,1007,Shang-Chi and the legend of The Ten Rings - enjoyably unMarvellous film. 80%,"""Shang-Chi and the legend of The Ten Rings"" is a superhero origin story which seems more like a Chinese martial arts film than the next entrant in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Many years ago I saw ""Crouching tiger, hidden dragon"" and found the fight scenes in that literally unbelievable a lot of the time. ""Shang-Chi"" often seems subtle in its fight scenes by comparison but then does have action sequences which are more like MCU superhero films. As an origin story, it assumes no familiarity with the MCU and in fact plays mostly as a non-MCU film, which is what I liked about it.

Simu Liu plays Shang-Chi/Shaun, the son of a mobster, Xu Wenwu (played by Tony Leung) who could quite easily have been the subject of a film or franchise himself, due to his legendary characteristics. Shang-Chi's mother Ying Li (played by Fala Chen) is also a legendary kind of character. This contrast of 'Eastern' legendary figures and 'Western' MCU legendary figures worked to the former's advantage, as the latter often come across as plastic toy figurines being used in a sandpit by small boys to play with.

The plot concerns how Shang-Chi/Shaun sought to move from under the shadow of his father to become his own man but just when he thought he was out, he is pulled back into Wenwu's orbit. The film mixes the seriousness, perhaps, of Chinese martial arts films with the jokey style of American Hollywood films. As should be expected from a MCU film, eventually the fate of the world will come into play and someone will have to play the hero to save it.

The martial arts in this film juxtaposes frenetic fight sequences with elegant and fluid fight scenes which have their own particular charm. Other times the action sequences seem lifted from a Disney live action family film and that was enjoyable too, if you just suspended disbelief.

Speaking of comedy, I found the earliest instance of this to be aiming very low for laughs, which isn't uncommon in MCU films but I warmed to later instances of it. For instance, I was amused by the character of a thespian who sounded like he was from Liverpool, when he reminisced about what he took from a film that he saw as a teenager and how that inspired him to get into acting. That actor playing the thespian did seem familiar, perhaps for his voice but I did recognise his name in the closing credits and remembered the role that he is perhaps best known for.

An interesting aspect to this film is its subject matter, i.e. An Asian superhero and a mostly Asian cast. Is this another attempt by Hollywood to crack the now important Chinese market? If it is, then the cooling relations between the US and China is an unwelcome fly in the ointment for Hollywood studios trying to make a lot of money from Chinese cinemagoers.

Another question that came into my mind was whether ""The Ten Rings"" is based on Chinese legend or is a Marvel appropriation of Chinese culture, tailored for 'Western' audiences that don't care about cultural authenticity. If it isn't the former, then I think that there could be a niche for films which mine authentic 'Eastern' legends and myths. That could be something which might interest me (Sinophiles would no doubt reel out a long list of films which have done just that!).

As you might have guessed, I wasn't the first in line to see this film. In fact, I wasn't even sure that I wanted to see it, as I haven't watched every line of superhero films in the MCU (maybe I should watch ""The Black Panther""?). As it stands, I think it was worth the punt in seeing it. I'd go so far as to say that seeing a sequel to this would be more appealing if it wasn't tied to The Avengers franchise! Furthermore, I would have liked this film not to remind that it was part of the MCU, which it managed to do, at least until the closing credits, which I didn't welcome when it made its first appearance. With that being said, this is the kind of film that you could watch again, after a suitable break. Although I didn't watch this film in 3D, it might be worth it to do so (as sometimes the extra cost of the ticket gives added value to the experience and...sometimes it doesn't).

Notes to self:

* The narrative did have some logical gaps in it, for example why Shang-Chi was attacked on the bus. What was that all about?

* The film was dedicated to the memory of Brad Allan, I think. Not sure who that was...searching now, a few websites list him as the supervising stunt coordinator.

* Reading the closing credits, I was reminded that this film was shot in Australia, which isn't obvious watching it, so, good job studio (I think I saw or heard something on ABC in Australia about how Asian Australians got to be in this film, perhaps a kung fu exponent or exponents)!

* My score for this film was tracking from 75% (7 out of 10 stars) to 75+% (8 out 10 stars) to just a flat 80% final score.","""Shang-Chi and the legend of The Ten Rings"" is a superhero origin story which seems more like a Chinese martial arts film than the next entrant in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU).

It's easily the best Marvel movie post-Infinity Saga (I know, that's not exactly saying much), and is very promising for the quality of Marvel's next projects. We have probably the second best villain intimately tied to the origin of a new, entertaining, and capable hero full of potential, in a story that ties the universe together and teases upcoming events in tantalising and unexpected ways. The fight choreography was on point, the dialogue was seeped in cultural significance, the jokes all land, and the CGI is some of the best since Thanos himself. Shang-Chi is an all-out success for Marvel, it seems in multiple ways - both critically and financially. Really its only downfall is that at times this doesn't feel like that much of a movie about Shang-Chi himself purely because his origin is tied so closely to the story of the Ten Rings. Instead it's a Ten Rings movie featuring Shang-Chi, which is fine, but feels a bit weird for his introduction into the MCU. And yes, the Ten Rings are tied up with the Iron Man films perfectly, almost making the whole Aldrich Killian thing better in retrospect. I give Shang-Chi a high 8/10, with promise of moving up with rewatches.","Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings far surpassed any expectations I had.

1009,1009,Feast for the eyes...,"I can't decide whether I loved this movie because it's great or if it's just the best cinematography Bill Pope's done since The Wachowski's ""The Matrix"" trilogy?

Either way, ""Shang-Chi"" is easily the most visually distinctive & stunning film in the MCU thus far - vibrant, kinetic, gorgeously framed / composed, with its own individualistic sense of personality - & the symbiosis between the fight choreography & camera work supercedes that of any previous installment in the Marvel franchise - resulting in an incredible style that works effortlessly throughout... I can't stress this enough - some moments are honestly breathtaking (my jaw was on the floor) & it's an utter joy to see such expertly constructed & perfectly timed sequences - of pure, unapologetic cinema - unfold. Allows the audience the uncommon opportunity to just sit back & relax whilst watching, safe in the knowledge those responsible for bringing the screenplay to life are trustworthy, capable hands. Hence, the creator's dependability reassures viewers that they can simply focus on enjoying the experience instead, making it even more fun.

Although I shouldn't be surprised everything's captured so masterfully - considering the reliably quirky inventiveness of the visionary director of photography at the helm of the project - despite his legendary status, I still wasn't expecting a solo film (made by such an infamously corporate production company which normally shuns creative experimentation of any kind, churning out unadventurous, generic, copy + paste origin stories) to be so shockingly well realised on screen, it would consequently make ""Avengers: Endgame"" look embarrassingly trivial & unengaging by comparison... Yet somehow, under the watchful eye of director Destin Daniel Cretton, together, this duo manage to accomplish exactly that successfully, capturing scenes with a unique confidence I rarely (if ever) see in recent comic book adaptations.

For instance, usually, I can't stand the bland, dull, grey, lifeless aesthetics of Disney movies (renowned for their very ugly colour grading & over reliance on CGI) but the filmmaking here feels as uncharacteristically bold, audacious, awe inspiring, original, immersive & as epic as James Wan's ""Aquaman"" or James Cameron's ""Avatar"", utilising VFX effectively to enhance the scale of the tale being told, rather than detract from the overall plot. Of course, technically impressive world building & enormous scale / grandiosity are meaningless qualities & hollow attributes to possess if the narrative lacks depth or engaging characters but thankfully, this offers just enough heart to additionally feel emotionally investable, as well as spectacular.

Wish I could've seen this in the theatre.","I can't decide whether I loved this movie because it's great or if it's just the best cinematography Bill Pope's done since The Wachowski's ""The Matrix"" trilogy?

1015,1015,Surprisingly good.,"I have to say that this was a surprisingly good movie. I say surprisingly because Marvel (or DC for that matter) have not exactly excelled in making even decent movies for quite some time. That the woke ""critics"" on Rotten Tomatoes gave it high ratings was a bit of a red flag as well but not only was the movie rather free from woke ramblings and preaching but it was a very fun and entertaining movie to watch.

The movie starts off in a somewhat bizarre way with Shang-Chi and his girlfriend swiping a car from a valet parking and going for a joy ride. It turns out that they are telling their story to a couple of friends and that is pretty much how this movie is told.

It begins more or less right away with some nice action and it continues that away with plenty of action sequences intermixed with story telling. The action and martial arts is really good in my opinion. They are in stark contrast to the mediocre rubbish we were treated to in Snake Eyes. The latter which was quite a disappointment.

This movie relies heavily on fantasy elements with tie ins to Doctor Strange, especially towards the end. Another movie that I liked a lot by the way. Thus there are of course plenty of special effects and CGI. Most of them good or very good. I really liked the beautiful world of Ta Lo. The combat scenes, especially when the rings are in action are both cool and beautiful.

There are quite a lot of comical relief in the movie as well and, for once, it is not to silly, outrageous or plain stupid. It contributes well to the enjoyment factor of the movie. The washed out actor is a bit on the limit but otherwise it works well with the rest of the movie. That guy on the bus starting to film and make commentaries was quite hilarious for instance.

The story? Well it is a Marvel special effects movie so one should not expect too much but the story is not bad. It mostly holds together and works well enough to tie all the action together. The acting is pretty much the same thing. One should not expect too much but it is good enough. It was nice to see Michelle Yeoh as Ying Nan though. She was one of the few cool characters in Discovery and she does know how to act.

Overall I very much enjoyed this movie. It is a simple super hero and fantasy adventure story with lots of action and special effects and with the single purpose of entertaining the audience that doesn't fall in the trap of trying to ""educate"" said audience.","I have to say that this was a surprisingly good movie.

1016,1016,Surprisingly entertaining for MCU's 4th phase,"Now that we're finally into the fourth phase of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, we're getting to see the deep cuts from everyone's favorite superhero community. Despite having an unnecessarily long title, 'Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings' is a fun ride that doesn't feel like a retread of Marvel films past.

The introduction to Shaun (Shang-Chi, portrayed by Simu Liu) is handled well, as the character is likable and feels like a good fit among the established members of S. H. I. E. L. D. Comic relief comes in the form of Awkwafina's Katy - sidekick to Shaun - and an atypical showing by Sir Ben Kingsley, while more serious performances are delivered by veteran actors Tony Chiu-Wai Leung and Michelle Yeoh.

As for the plot, it can almost be split in two, as the first and second halves of 'Shang-Chi' feel like completely different films. The first half is very unserious and comes off as a companion to the latest 'Spider-man' entries, whereas the second half is a more traditional Marvel action-drama. Even though there are plenty of typical superhero tropes thrown in here with even more of a Disney imprint than past MCU movies, it's still enjoyable for what it is.

The somewhat surprising strength of 'Shang-Chi' suggests there's no slowing down in the MCU film factory.","Now that we're finally into the fourth phase of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, we're getting to see the deep cuts from everyone's favorite superhero community.

1017,1017,Sort of disappointed..,"I got to admit I wasn't particularly blown away by anything in the movie.. I might even say ""I was bored"" by it.

Don't get me wrong.. it IS a spectacle! The action is great. The locations are nice, costume design, sound design, etc. But it is overall a soft release not worth seeing in theaters.. specially as a follow-up to what Endgame was.

The biggest problem for me, is how the underwritten lead has muddled personality (for reasons covered in the story) devoid of charm, personality or good dialogue.

The next issue is the humor, which didn't land for me.. Not once. The supporting lead Awkwafina isn't her normal ""loud"" self that's supposed to be funny every time she opens her mouth. Her role is very supportive and a little dramatic. And while I questioned myself why was she even there for, it doesn't ultimately matter. She is another forgettable character that is given more importance than the role deserves.

Finally, the third act is weak. There's a balancing problem with stakes. You can't feel tension or weight to any action. And there's a lot of superficial ""I can't do it"" until they can.

In the end, this feels like a very safe plot, written in a way to appeal to china (considering how the Mandarin is portrayed), that ends up appealing to no one specific. Certainly doesn't feel like a Marvel movie.. but it was bound to happen if we are to be introduced to different aspects of the narrative. But it also doesn't feel like a comic book. It's more generic than that.","I got to admit I wasn't particularly blown away by anything in the movie.. I might even say ""I was bored"" by it.

And as it can not miss in marvel movies, the good comedy part too."
1019,1019,Bold & Brilliant,"A bold step for the MCU, incorporating an Eastern cinema approach into it's franchise. With it's foundations built on choreography and humour, Shang-Chi beautifully brings in elements of famed Kung-Fu films and Chinese culture.

The cast, perhaps largely unknown in most of the world, perform excellently and those performances are centred on the movements within the film. Taking inspiration from many martial arts, the action scenes - whilst exaggerated and outlandish in comparison to the film's peers - are brilliant. The addition of Kingsley is truly excellent too, as he and Awkwafina provide the majority of laughs.

A standalone plot whilst maintaining links to the MCU, Shangi-Chi creates a new platform for Marvel to explore, although clearly sets up the next Phase along with other releases from the year. The standout element is the creation of the new world and it's creatures though, a huge Disney budget bringing to life fabled animals long deserving of a spotlight.","A bold step for the MCU, incorporating an Eastern cinema approach into it's franchise.

1020,1020,Shang Chi and the legend of the ten rings,,
1021,1021,The Master of Kung-fu,"Shang chi and the legend of the ten rings we follow the story of a guy named Shang(Simu Liu) who lives your basic life In San Francisco. Working as a Valet parking car, and partying late nights with his best friend Katy(Awkwafina). Until one day a band of assassins targets Shang and it's revealed that he's actually an assassin trained at birth by his father Wenwu(Tony Leung Chiu-Wai). The leader of the ten rings an ancient Chinese organization that's existence for thousands of years, conquering kingdoms and overthrowing governments. Now Shang-Chi must faces his father and overcome the demons of his past. Each of these Marvel films I find most enjoyable is the world building, set up of this universal series. All these characters from various backgrounds and classes and worlds. Shang-Chi I can say is one of those welcome new additions. Similar to Guardians of the galaxy when this was announced I hadn't the slightest idea who this guy was. Usually when people think Martial artists with marvel they usually think Iron fist or daredevil. So going into this I had a blank expectation of what to see. It does pay tribute to old-school martial arts films while mixing fast action charm of a comic book with a blend of Chinese mythology and philosophy. It does helps gives the movie an identity and the characters overall I found them good not great, but I found them entertaining and likable. Shang's more or less just an ordinary guy just trying to live his life. Have fun make a new start and make the best of it. He's honestly more or less happy with his basic life. Though at the same time running from his old life his father,mother and sister. It all leaves an impact on him as a person. He's pretty emotional not Peter Parker emotional, but he still has a personality outside of just having a stoic Shaolin fighter serious persona. They could have easily done a chosen one theme with him that been done to death. He likes to joke and have fun along with his friend Katy. Awkwafina I'm not a fan of her I didn't really care for her in crazy Rich Asians or Raya and the last dragon. Here I found her character more funny and likable. She doesn't really come off as that annoying friend that's more or less in the way. Her and Simu do play well off each other and display this friendship of two different people who still very similar. I got sort of Rush hour vibe off them, there's even a fight scene outside on a bamboo scaffolding. She's not just a pointless tagalong she does have moments where the jokes don't work , though she does add to the film specifically in the finale. The tone of the movie still finds time to flesh them out. More or less the two of them are just goofballs at the beginning, once more's revealed it does take time to have it's more deep serious moments. Wenwu I found to be a really good villain and While technically this still isn't really the Mandarin that comic readers we're probably expecting. His overall character is very compelling he more borders the line like killmonger. You understand his reasons though his actions are unjustifiable. He does still manages to gives off this somewhat opposing demeanor not from his fighting, but from the way he present his self. I buy this guy used to be a tyrant and a Conqueror. I still wish his rings worked the same way though, really he just throws them like chakra and whips them around. As for the sister she's given minimal in this not really alot of moments. Outside of her childhood flash backstory it's clear later down the road their gonna do something her. The visuals are stunning to this one water effect the just pops off the screen. The use of elements being shown through the right use of slow motion. The landscape of Tao lo which has this very traditional Chinese style with Nine-tail foxes, and Fu dog(lions) that make that the rhinos from black panther looks bad. I want to see more places like this in future installments. A lot of these cg effects are on par with doctor strange.","Shang chi and the legend of the ten rings we follow the story of a guy named Shang(Simu Liu) who lives your basic life In San Francisco.

1022,1022,Simply entertaining,"When shang chi was announced in phase 4, i got excited because i am a fan of martial arts films. But after the pandemic, i slowly started losing interest in the film because i felt that mcu won't be as good after endgame and my fear turned true with the post endgame movies. None of the films or series satisfied me. I saw shang chi with low expectations and got fully satisfied.

What i loved about shang chi the most was its entertaining. Post endgame, mcu got burdened with expectations to connect their films into a universe, set up future films and do something different but in that process forgot to provide entertainment. On the other hand, shang chi is not burdened with any of these and tells a simple and independent story. There is no deliberate connecting to the mcu, nor they are in a hurry to set up any sequels, also its not anything different as its a typical Chinese martial arts mythological film. The action scenes in train and skyscraper were mindblowing and best hand to hand action scenes after winter soldier(which black widow failed to provide). The female stars were also badass. The climax cgi action was okay.

Only drawback is there is nothing new in the plot as its that typical mcu storyline where our hero has daddy issues.

On the whole, shang chi and the legend of ten rings is a very good standalone mcu film after thor ragnarok.","When shang chi was announced in phase 4, i got excited because i am a fan of martial arts films.

1023,1023,Exciting and heartwarming,,
1024,1024,A diverse new addition,"Shang Chi and the Legend of the Ten rings is one of the marvel's first phase 4 movies. In hindsight it has a underlying tone and story similar to that of Black Panther. Both being representations of certain groups and and their cultures.

The story is solid. It wasn't perfect as it had some minor flaws. A bit cheesy with good writing and comedy but nothing exceptional. The fight scenes , the choreography and dragons were cool which were refreshing compared to the last couple of MCU movies that were released. The characters are nothing to interesting other than Shang Chi and his dad and their whole dynamic.

Overall an enjoyable film. An eyecandy with some flaws but nonetheless was watchable and likable.

Overall an enjoyable film. An eyecandy with some flaws but nonetheless was watchable and likable.

Memorable: No Rewatchable: Unlikely.."
1025,1025,"What a waste of time, the other way around geographically","Too unrealistic movie, with too much special effect that they do not bother to cover up. Humoristic moments do not seem that funny. Also, how a thin someone holdoff a big guy?

Ugh, it is that classic moves of Hollywood and phrases. Like the headphone did not hear you. Or foreigner moving oversea. Suddenly it looks like how they are picturing America especially in the cab. Like your pants joke, hell no phrase when looking at height. Or was looking everywhere for you. Burn it down. Classic moves like using multiple people as a stair.

Hate it also that sometimes they just speak English but mostly Chinese, wondering what they want.

How much did the Chinese pay Disney?

Using big actors and adding a new guy in to keep the quality of the acting, with a bad script it does not do well. Especially when there is no innovative action in the players. They were copy and paste from another movie they played before.

Classic scenarios making it so predictable, and fights that could not be won due to lack of experience are own suddenly.

Acting is below average, quality of screen is high but too much special effect, camera work is OK because it has gotten took over multiple of times by special effects so can not give any real points. Sound is below average because they're using too much overused kinds.

1 time only movie. Points are given to the cast because they still try to make something out of it but still not pulling tit off and meeting the script only. Some points for the innovativeness idea.","Too unrealistic movie, with too much special effect that they do not bother to cover up. Humoristic moments do not seem that funny.

1026,1026,Destin Daniel Cretton; you've done it again!,"Marvel's latest feature introduces cinephiles to Shaun AKA Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) a martial arts master and a character created by Steve Englehart and Jim Starlin, first appearing in a Marvel publication back in 1973. Beginning in the first of many gorgeously choreographed and shot sequences, we're introduced to Shang-Chi's father Xu Wenwu (Tony Chiu-Wai Leung) and mother Li (Fala Chen) also entailing the awesome power of the Ten Rings which Xu currently has in his possession. What follows is a heart-pounding and ridiculously entertaining adventure movie with true heart.

Filled with beautiful performances not least from everyone already mentioned and including Awkwafina as Shaun's best friends Katy and Meng'er Zhang as sister Xialing, there's plenty here to adore on screen not even getting to the truly awe-inspiring action set pieces with the best fight scenes I've seen in recent memory. Cretton (Short Term 12, Just Mercy) is very quickly becoming one of my favourite directors having produced three incredible pieces of cinema in the last 8 years. It's great to see that his passion for storytelling and independent spirit still shines through his latest here while also staying true to the Marvel fan base (I really did not expect a certain character to show up but made for some really comical moments).

The visual effects are of course stunning but what makes them stand out here are how they're incorporated with the beautiful landscapes to enhance the feeling of authentically experiencing Shaun's heritage and getting wrapped up in the culture that the filmmakers so wonderfully explore. This is how origin stories should be made! The creature design is also incredible and is an integral element to making the final sequences all the more breathtaking.

Please do yourselves a favour and see this on the biggest screens possible, please support your local cinema and stay safe my friends.","Marvel's latest feature introduces cinephiles to Shaun AKA Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) a martial arts master and a character created by Steve Englehart and Jim Starlin, first appearing in a Marvel publication back in 1973.

1027,1027,Not a good movie,"This movie was a fist in the face or rather a razor fist. I don't know if the movie is bad or I can't watch Marvel movies anymore but I didn't like anything about this movie, neither the story, nor the special effects, nor the acting. It all seemed too exaggerated and predictable, plus two hours is really too much for a movie of this type.

The only interesting parts were the first minutes where you see the meeting between the parents and the clash between the abomination and the monk whose name I don't remember.

I think instead the worst part was the final battle, even the too long and exaggerated one.","This movie was a fist in the face or rather a razor fist.

This is the first time I felt sleepy for an action movie. I feel like i wasted my money, despite availing the Super Tuesday offer. The Suicide Squad was far much better in terms of storyboard.

The first half of the film was very good, the story, and especially the impressive fight scenes. However, later in the film we constantly get some new elements, the story expands, there is not always an explanation, and the worst part of the film was my last fight because I think they went too far with special effects, for me personally it was not watchable. The bad guys overall were just solid, nothing special. Of course, at the end of the film we have a scene that shows us how to look for (at least) another film.","Solid pop corn film.

1030,1030,Finally something good again from Marvel,"Marvel has not done much good lately. 2 horrible TV shows, and 1 bad TV show. Not a single good movie since Captain Marvel, and nothing seemingly good coming over the horizon.

To be honest I have started to give up. Marvel have produced magnificent movies and great entertainment for many years, but lately it is like that magic has come off and they seem much more run of the mill basic with that, by now, boring Marvel feel. Marvel has tried to introduce more political correctness, more feminism, and more nonsense diversity, and it has all failed.

This movie however is not a failure.

Why?

This movie is simple, it is to the point, it follows tropes, cliches, and it is a classic heroes journey - which is exactly why it works!

Marvel took a classical story we all heard, read and seen before but they switched a few things around, kept some of that Marvel feel, and made it play out mainly in China and almost only with Chinese actors. And it works!

Imagine that? Sure you can find some political nonsense if you look hard enough, but who cares when you have great fight scenes, lovely sceneries, a great (but basic) story and brilliant well written characters.

We even get a villain that you understand, sympathise with and even feel a sting of ""ah, too bad"" about him.

This is how you make an action movie! Great stuff Marvel!

The points I deduct is due to the movie not being that amazing. They pull the heroes journey of sure, but we have also seen it done better. Sound is great, but not amazing, directing is great, but not amazing, etc. Etc. Everything about this movie is high class, greatly done, and well performed, but it is not on top, it is not amazing nor perfect.

I also have a few objections about the background story and the ending, but I am keeping this spoiler free so...

8/10. This is a great movie and highly entertaining, and definitely worth the ticket price. Go see and get your faith in Marvel restored.","Marvel has not done much good lately. 2 horrible TV shows, and 1 bad TV show.

At the very top tier of MCU movies - characters, lore, acting, action, fighting, visual effects! :-)","The entire cast was perfect, especially Simu Liu, Awkwafina, Tony Leung, Michelle Yeoh, Ben Kingsley, and Ronny Chieng! :-) Spectacular visual effects -and- awesome fight scenes! :-)","The entire cast was perfect, especially Simu Liu, Awkwafina, Tony Leung, Michelle Yeoh, Ben Kingsley, and Ronny Chieng! :-) Spectacular visual effects -and- awesome fight scenes! :-)"
1034,1034,"With Shang-Chi, Marvel presents their first Asian superhero in a good and cultural way.","Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is a new superhero movie in the Marvel film series. The film is directed and written in part by Destin Daniel Cretton, the director of Short Term 12 and Just Mercy.

The film is about Shaun (Simu Liu), who tries to put his past behind him and just wants to enjoy his life with his best friend Katy (Awkwafina). When the mysterious organization the Ten Rings finds Shaun, he is forced to confront his past after all. To do this, he must take his birth name Shang-Chi again, to protect Katy and his sister Xialing (Meng'er Zhang) from the actions of the Ten Rings and their leader Xu WenWu the Mandarin (Tony Chiu-Wai Leung) who is also Shaun. His father.

This film is Marvel's first superhero film starring an Asian actor. Furthermore, with this film they also bring out the Asian culture and fighting styles well. For this they have used other movies like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon as an example. Fans of this film can recognize moments that refer back to these films. They portray the fight scenes where characters fight each other with Asian fighting styles well and entertainingly. The art of the Asian fighting style is somewhat overshadowed when characters use more supernatural powers in the film. Fight scenes where this happens are less exciting and entertaining than scenes where characters fight each other in more normal ways.

At one point, the film also feels like you're watching a live-action mix of the Asian animation shows Pokémon and Avatar: The Last Airbender. These scenes provide some extra comedy and are especially more entertaining for younger viewers. The movies and costumes of the film cast also help with the emergence of Asian culture in the film. The visual effects are also put to good use in the film. Except for a few scenes, it can be seen that they have used a green screen for the background, but fortunately this is not disturbing in the film. Creatures can also be returned before the start of the film. A bit redundant on a few action scenes with 3D effects in the film.

The acting is well done by the film cast. Simu Liu took to Twitter to ask Marvel to play the part, with both parties quickly making a good deal. Simu Liu comes across as good and charismatic as the lead of the film and further conveys the action sequences beautifully. Along with Awkwafina, he also has good chemistry in the film and together provide good appropriate humor. The comedy also doesn't overshadow all the dramatic aspects in the film, which sometimes does happen. Tony Chiu-Wai Leung also portrays the villain of the film in a good and sympathetic way, so that as a viewer you understand why he does what he is doing to me. This film is also only his first English-language role in an American film. Although this is only his first time, he still delivers good and appropriate acting. Meng'er Zhang does not get that much time in the film, but a bit less good or present in the film.","Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is a new superhero movie in the Marvel film series.

The storyline was alright but the CG was very good. They used lots of Chinese culture tradition, costume & symbols. Looking forward to see the next sequel.","When the movie first started...

Though it had a predictable plot just like other Disney films, due to its brilliant execution you'll be glued to the screen. Awkwafina as Katy was my favourite character of the film as all the comedy punches were delivered through her character.

There is no humour. No sense of fun. It feels like a generic kung fu movie and that we have seen it all before.. I saw the ending way before we got there and above all, it was boring.

Awkwafina was intensely annoying as ever with her grating personality and spouting exposition all the time.

It depends a lot on the visual effects, its main characters can be funny but not nice, the story does not generate much interest and we have seen the fights many times and in a better way in almost any film produced in Hong Kong, Indonesia or Thailand of the last twenty years. The only thing that saves this film is the karaoke scene that is unexpectedly welcome. The rest is routine, mediocre, tiring and bland.","Let's agree that it is a bad movie from multiple points of view.

1047,1047,Chinese culture goes to the world,,
1048,1048,Another fabulous addition to MCU's Phase 4!,"The much-awaited Shangi Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings released today in theatres. It follows the journey of Shang Chi (Simu Liu), the son of the famed MCU villain the Mandarin, who revolts against his father to fight evil.

The first stand-alone film featuring an Asian American superhero, Shang Chi understandably stands out with its close combat sequences. All the actors and especially Simu Liu have undergone extensive martial arts training and it shows, with a sensational sequence on a moving bus in San Francisco and another on a bamboo scaffolding in Macau, the standouts.

Awkwafina and a surprise returning character from the MCU provide genuine, sarcasm-laced comedy that adds another wonderful layer to the experience. Cameos from Benedict Wong and Ronnie Chieng also manage to leave the audience in spits.

Without stooping to cultural appropriation, with an all-Asian crew, director Destin Daniel Cretton pays rich tribute to Chinese heritage at every turn. Hong Kong's superstars Tony Leung and Michelle Yeoh are electric in their roles and the fact that they don't seem to have lost a step with age, acing their action sequences, shows their dedication as performers.

Regarded as one of the finest actor's Chinese cinema has every produced, Tony Leung stamps his class all over the film, giving an engrossing, captivating performance as the dreaded leader of the Ten Rings.

His inner moral dilemmas and love/hate relationship with his children are portrayed brilliantly by the man nicknamed 'Small Tiger' among the Five Tiger Generals of Hong Kong Cinema

The flashback sequences help to build up Shang Chi as a character and intricately captures his upbringing as the heir-apparent to a genocidal megalomaniac, and how despite wanting nothing to do with his father's murderous tendencies, as his son, he is inadvertently drawn to the Mandarin's world of violence and carnage.

The films delves into mystical elements towards the climax and with two surprise-laden post-credit sequences tie into both Doctor Strange's world of Mystic Arts as well as a possible connection that the Ten Rings has to alien technology.

As always, the way weaves in each individual fim character to the wonderful tapestry that makes up each of its Phases is a joy in itself.

It is due to the well-written characters and the nuanced acting of its performers that Shang Chi stands out while the eye-catching CGI and elaborately chorographer action sequences add more gloss to the end product.

Another wonderful new addition to the MCU world and hopefully this paves the way for more ethnicities being represented in the universe as time goes on.

Highly recommended. A must watch. Marvel's Phase 4 continues to raise the bar!","The much-awaited Shangi Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings released today in theatres. It follows the journey of Shang Chi (Simu Liu), the son of the famed MCU villain the Mandarin, who revolts against his father to fight evil.

The first stand-alone film featuring an Asian American superhero, Shang Chi understandably stands out with its close combat sequences. All the actors and especially Simu Liu have undergone extensive martial arts training and it shows, with a sensational sequence on a moving bus in San Francisco and another on a bamboo scaffolding in Macau, the standouts.

Awkwafina and a surprise returning character from the MCU provide genuine, sarcasm-laced comedy that adds another wonderful layer to the experience. Cameos from Benedict Wong and Ronnie Chieng also manage to leave the audience in spits.

Without stooping to cultural appropriation, with an all-Asian crew, director Destin Daniel Cretton pays rich tribute to Chinese heritage at every turn. Hong Kong's superstars Tony Leung and Michelle Yeoh are electric in their roles and the fact that they don't seem to have lost a step with age, acing their action sequences, shows their dedication as performers.

Regarded as one of the finest actor's Chinese cinema has every produced, Tony Leung stamps his class all over the film, giving an engrossing, captivating performance as the dreaded leader of the Ten Rings.

1049,1049,Miscast,"I'm sorry but the leading man here is a definite miscast. Or is it because Tony Leung and Awkwfina stole the show? Hmmmmmm......

While the MCU movies are getting too formulaic I'm hesitant to say the next 10 year is starting out rather uninteresting. Shang Chi is basically a Chinese cash grab in the lineage of Black Panther. It is uninspiring, routine and CGI oriented.

Back to casting the main lead, I'm suggesting either John Cho (star trek, Cowboy Bobep,) or Chang Chen (Dune) would be an upgrade. While Falan Chen is sufficient the role is a thankless one. As to the story I would love to see more of grandma and take out Ben Kingsley's.

I mean Hawkeye series is better, if how so ever slightly. I understand the fantastic elements are tributes to the Chinese culture. Of course Kingsley and that strange pet is trying hard to be comedic but is rather forced. Overall it's a surface scratcher only. So disappointed.","I'm sorry but the leading man here is a definite miscast. Or is it because Tony Leung and Awkwfina stole the show? Hmmmmmm......

Thanks to scintillating cast who lit up the screen especially charismatic Tony Leung.

Chemistry between Simu & Awkwafina as besties are undeniably good.

Action scenes including CGI works definitely made some nice highlights.

1051,1051,New Avenger has Arrived!!!,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is one of the biggest MCU film ever made, with loads of action, Kung Fu, and lots of fun. Simi Liu has nailed the new superhero character. The choreography was brilliant, the VFX was pretty well done, and the cast and crew did such an amazing job making this movie happen. I hope we get to see Shang-Chi once again, maybe in the new Avengers or the sequel if they make that happen in the future of the MCU.

1052,1052,I give it Ten Rings!,"Let me commence by saying this movie is by far one of the most-fun, action packed Marvel movies ever!

Simu Liu is the perfect Marvel protagonist, and Awkwafina delivers the obligatory yet welcomed dose of humor you'd come to expect from a Marvel presentation.

But beyond that this movie is rich with mythology, adventure, and incredible martial arts combat that cannot be described with another phrase other than breathtaking, to be the introduction of a new character the story is well-written and you feel as if he had been with us from the start,

I give this move the 10 it deserves, In Marvel We Trust.","Let me commence by saying this movie is by far one of the most-fun, action packed Marvel movies ever!

My favourite Chinese lady actress (of whose films I have seen nearly all), Michelle Yeoh, is her usual perfect self.

Top notch film and best of the MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe) to date...after 'AVENGERS: ENDGAME (2019) of course.","This was a case of 3rd time lucky for me; as I was totally disappointed with the dismal, 'GHOST IN THE SHELL' and the utterly abysmal 'SNAKE EYES' rubbish.

This movie is the Asian one, taking inspiration from Chinese Mythology and Kung-Fu in this action-adventure. Great fight scenes and chases expertly shot, the downside is that most of it looks entirely computer generated. The comedian I don't like made me disappointed again, but once the 2nd comedic side kick joined it was a lot more funny. Strong start, middling middle and an ending which lacked motivation.

That being said, the middle 45 minutes of this film had me nearly falling asleep, literally. The character development just couldn't hook me at all because it felt like they kept revisiting the same points.

On a positive note, the visuals and martial arts are absolutely spectacular. The first act of the film contains most of the martial arts and it is so crisp and well-choreographed. The final act flexes all of the CGI dollas and they make they already big budget stretch far, with some of the more impressive sights you will see in a Marvel movie so far. This movie didn't quite hit the 8/10 for me to recommend people see it in theatres, but lets tack that up to me being tired and you go see it anyway!","Let me preface this by saying that my enjoyment of the movie may have been dampered by a poor night's sleep.

1060,1060,Vey Nice,"Thoroughly enjoyed watching this movie. Not one bit is boring and the comedy is really good and appropriate and not cringey like some other Marvel movies.

This is not an ""8"" 8 for me, but it's not a 7 either, more like 7.6 but then again, IMDb doesn't have half stars for some reasons.

The fight choreography is amazing and this one has some of the best hand-to-hand action in Marvel. It kinda gets ridiculous in the end and you feel like it's not in the MCU, but MCU is already ridiculous so this is not that far-fetched.

The acting of all of them was good especially the father.

The ""villain"" is really relatable and well-written, even though I felt like we needed more time with him, this much is enough to make you actually feel and understand why he does what he does and is kinda not the bad guy.

The story and characters could've used some more fleshing out, especially Shaun's sister.

Story and characters might be cliché but they use those clichés well and make you care about these characters and that's the most important part. I just wish there was more showing and not telling.

The CGI was not that good and it's really noticeable especially at the end. They should've worked on it more and polished it.

Not using gore and cuss words because they want their movies to be PG-13 really hurts these movies, even though they can use at least one f word but for some reason they don't, I'm not saying that f word can make the movie better, but sometimes you need something more than ""dam"" for the scene to be more impactful. Also, doesn't actually showing most of the flashbacks make them more impactful? Why does the camera turn away from the ""death"" scenes that can make the movie better? This is why not showing a little bit of blood and gore hurts these movies, these movies keep pulling their punches back, and believe me no one cares if you used some more gruesome scenes. How are you gonna make a Deadpool 3 and Blade movie then?

All in all, very enjoyable movie with good martial arts fights, characters, music choice, and a decent story. I might like it better when I see it a second time, but right now I'm kinda lukewarm about it. Really looking forward to seeing more of what Shang-Chi's gonna do in the MCU.","Thoroughly enjoyed watching this movie.

First off, I loved all the characters, such as Shang-Chi, Katy, Xu Wenwu, Xialing, Razor Fist, Death Dealer, the return of Trevor Slattery, Morris, and of course Master Guang Bo. The actors for all these characters were also perfect. They suited their roles perfectly. In my opinion, this movie had some of the best supporting characters in the MCU. I also loved the action. It was absolutely amazing, there were some points in the movie where I felt like I was watching a martial arts movie. The stunts and the choreography were perfect, I couldn't have asked for anything more. The effects in this movie were also stunning. The moving forest, the mythical creatures (especially the dragon), and the effects used on the Ten Rings were super cool. The effects in this movie were some of the best in the MCU. Lastly, I also loved the plot, it just sat really well with me.

This movie was like nothing we have ever seen before in the MCU. It was very unique and a nice twist for Marvel. The first Credit Scene was also very interesting and might have set up phase 4 in the MCU. This was a great movie, and I definitely recommend going to see it, even if you aren't a Marvel fan.","This movie was great, it was entertaining, it was fast paced, and it was unique.

1063,1063,A solid superhero adventure...,"Like many, I was concerned that this new Marvel Cinematic Universe saga would have trouble living up to previous standards but Shang-Chi has already left me hopeful for the series' future. I literally know nothing about this character but I found his film debut to be a solid superhero adventure; well acted, effectively character-driven, occasionally funny, rich with cultural representation and booming with swift and stylized martial arts action. It has what I hoped I was going to get from Black Panther: inclusivity AND an interesting world and narrative. I'm 100% all for representation but the story and characters must be pronounced, too and I just found this entry to be a lot more distinguished and captivating.

Although Shang-Chi treads the familiar origin story formula, there's a few fresh twists and turns that uniquely sets this character's journey apart from the others. Though the first half is decently entertaining with some identifiable drama and fast-paced yet slightly derivative set-pieces in urban environments, the second half is where the film really turns on (at least for me). The Chinese philosophy kicks in, the mythology is abundant, there's tons of visually striking imagery, a fantastical setting, loads of insane action choreography. The Asian representation is just off the chain and I was so enraptured by it. It doesn't feel contrived, I sensed a great deal of respect for it and all the while an engaging story was unfolding. A nice balance. I was very satisfied with what I saw. I'm really looking forward to seeing more of Shang-Chi's world and how it'll tie in with other stories yet-to-come. Very cool movie.

1072,1072,Worst story and plot ever.,"This is by far the most nonsensical plot in a Marvel film and one of the worst stories I've ever witnessed. It's so hard to make sense of anything at all in this film. The only good thing is some of the action sequences. Bus fight is spectacular but after that it goes completely downhill cause only after that does the plot actually unfold. And it is so ridiculous and so full of nonsense that I was thoroughly bored whenever anything other than the fight scenes were on.

I think Marvel is done. This phase seems completely relying on the success of the previous one. The only good thing is Spider-Man and I'm eagerly looking forward to No Way Home. After this I don't have any expectations from Marvel films other than Spider-Man.

The humour in this movie is pure cringe. It feels too forced and Awkwafina is completely out of place. The last scene where they sing Hotel California is so damn cringy. It's a tragedy that they thought people would enjoy it. This is a really bad film minus the action sequences. Watch it only for the action which looks good on the big screen. Don't have even the slightest expectation from the story.","This is by far the most nonsensical plot in a Marvel film and one of the worst stories I've ever witnessed.

Although Simu Liu falters a little bit as a leading man, he has a truly impressive cast to support him. Awkwafina is brilliantly funny and quippy as she always is. And Tony Leung, the complex antagonist and the hero's father, has the most depth in this film.

The visual effects are beyond beautiful. They reminded me of Ferngully, and the nature I observed as a child. Good stuff!

There are some surprising cameos that are both hilarious and wholesome.

It was so good to see it in Imax after such a long cinema hiatus. Definitely check this one out!","I'm not someone who is a fan of action movies. I'm really not.

He groups up together along with his excellent pal Katy (Awkwafina) and his estranged sister Xialing (Meng'er Zhang) to forestall Wenwu for good.

Shang-Chi And The Legend Of The Ten Rings mark MCU's first Asian-led superhero film. There had been Asian characters before, inclusive of Wong (Benedict Wong) from Doctor Strange and Hogun (Tadanobu Asano) from Thor. But they have constantly been sidekicks, flunkeys, or comedian relief.

Wenwu is a powerful crime lord who runs an evil empire constructed across the energy of ten historical earrings that he makes use of to generate blasts of energy.

Shang-Chi is a heart-warming tale syringed with humor. Co-writer-director Destin Daniel Cretton knows his circle of relative dynamics and superbly units the tone. Despite the humanity on show, it is the revolutionary martial arts that are the USP. The movement would not depend closely on virtual trickery withinside the actual world.

The chemistry among the actors is palpable, exuding an actual feel of a located own circle of relatives. The film's actual villain is grief, pushed via way of means of Wenwu at the cost of his children.

1089,1089,Surprisingly good!,,
1090,1090,Some Underwhelming Parts but very Good on the Whole,"I've been watching Marvel films for years and while I do almost always enjoy them I often come out underwhelmed, Shang Chi actually managed to pleasantly surprise me and while I do think it dragged slightly in the third act I really enjoyed it.

The film manages to balance it's humour and seriousness far better than other marvel property's and also incorporates aspects from other films without feeling too forced, instead adding to the worldbuilding. The action is possibly the best of any Marvel film and obviously takes a lot of influence from Jackie Chan films with I believe the stunt coordinator having worked with Chan in the past. The acting is all good with Simu Liu really shining and while I wasn't a massive fan of Awkwafina's character at the start I did find myself liking her development in the final act, I think Shang Chi manages to take what works so well about the MCU and polish it but this doesn't mean it's without it's flaws.

I did enjoy the emotional link between the villain and Shang Chi, but I thought that there were far too many flash backs telling us of how this relationship has developed, I also think that the third act was a bit of a let down with the action evolving into pretty basic CGI fights and most of the personal edge that lent itself so well to the rivalry between Shang Chi and Win Wu being lost. There are also some big plot holes and things that just don't make sense, the score is underwhelming and I'm not a massive fan of some of the villain's costume designs, however while this film does have it's flaws it was still a very enjoyable movie that I will likely watch again, the cast is good, cinematography different from the usual stuff the MCU has to offer and I like that Marvel didn't shy away from using a lot of subtitles and having characters speaking lot's of Chinese. Very enjoyable and I'd recommend it to any Marvel fan. 7/10.","I've been watching Marvel films for years and while I do almost always enjoy them I often come out underwhelmed, Shang Chi actually managed to pleasantly surprise me and while I do think it dragged slightly in the third act I really enjoyed it.

1091,1091,"""Welcome to the circus""","It's always fun to go to the theater for a new MCU production -- a chance to see something **new** that you know will be well produced and will keep on stretching their shared universe of superheros. With Shang-Chi it looks like their Phase 4 is well and truly launched, and you can already glimpse what Marvel Studios' overall approach is going to be. (More below.)

Just like Black Widow was Marvel's run at doing a James Bond-type film, Shang-Chi is their try at doing the Chinese martial arts thing. The result is a kind of compromise Westernized version that falls between two poles. For sure though, you'll be entertained. There's more than enough action, a lot of strikingly beautiful settings, and fun characters. But before I forget -- the mid-credits scene is one of the best they've ever done and totally worth staying for. (That's where the quote I put in the title above comes from -- a certain familiar character telling Shang-Chi to sure, come on in and join the craziness.) It does the usual thing of tossing the baton forward to whatever the next production will be, but it's stylistically so clever that it really stands out.

And the film itself: it fills up its 2:12 runtime with a whole lot of material and a lot of characters. Maybe too much. The third act in particular veers off onto a fantasy-type track that doesn't entirely fit well with the previous hour and a half of setup, and the scenes in that last section suddenly feel more rushed. Gone are the days of the first Iron Man or Thor or Ant-Man movies with their lean, linear storylines and single well defined themes. Instead, Marvel now seems to want to overstuff every one of their productions, even if they involve 'secondary' MCU characters, and turn them into epics. More and bigger is not always better, is it?

I did like the cast. Marvel always does an impressive job bringing in good people. Nice to see there are no less than 4 (!) major roles for females, as opposed to 2 for males, and they mix and match well. Of the mostly young cast though, I thought the older pair (Tony Leung, Michelle Yeoh) really stood out -- they effortlessly dominate the screen when they are on. Leung's character could have been a stock, one-dimensional scenery-chewing villain, but he's much more nuanced than that. Simu Liu (the lead role, Shang-Chi) is not exactly a great actor just yet, but he's athletic and cute and attractive with a sense of humor and for this role he doesn't need to be much more than that. Awkwafina, as Katy, does her usual turn with comic relief and side commentary with a dash of romance. As for Trevor Slattery (Ben Kingsley) -- that came out of nowhere and he's absolutely out of place, but somehow it works partly because of his pet that rises to Disney levels of cuteness.

About Phase 4. The first three cycles introduced and used particular major characters that were all required to fit under the Avengers umbrella. Now it's the post-Avengers era and from their scheduled series of releases up through 2023, we'll see a much more diverse slate of characters and stories that don't obviously fall under a single umbrella. If they do have a Master Plan for something equivalent to the Avengers, it's hard to see what it is. Maybe, they'll use this new freedom just to show us interesting stories in a bigger universe.","It's always fun to go to the theater for a new MCU production -- a chance to see something **new** that you know will be well produced and will keep on stretching their shared universe of superheros.

1095,1095,"""Shang-Chi"" Brings Balance to the MCU","For nearly ten years after its inception, the Marvel Cinematic Universe was dominated by the adventures of white men. Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow had to fight to get her own film this year, while her male co-stars got entire trilogies . ""Black Panther"" reinvigorated the franchise with its celebration of African culture in 2018, proving that the Marvel brand didn't have to be so beige. ""Captain Marvel"" became the first MCU film to be fronted by a woman. Now, ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" marks the first Asian-led film. Not only does the film feature the first Asian protagonist, it also features a predominantly Asian cast and crew, which, thankfully, give this franchise a much needed change in perspective.

The Ten Rings have been around for nearly a thousand years, gifting their wearer, Wenwu, immortality so that he may rule with unmatched strength. After centuries of building an empire out of blood, Wenwu was turned away from a life of violence by Ying Li, a guardian of the mystical land of Ta Lo. When heartbreak struck shortly after, Wenwu picked up the rings once again, causing him to go down a dark path, and his son, Shang-Chi, to run away to the United States. Now after ten years, the son must come home to confront his father and become who he was truly meant to be.

Similar to what Ryan Coogler was able to do with ""Black Panther"", co-writer/director Destin Daniel Cretton brings out the best of this new world as he is able to handle the mountains of establishing exposition. His use of flashbacks may be a bit liberal, especially as the film reaches its climax, but they're used meaningfully to build upon a story focused on character and culture.

Without a leading acting credit to his name, Simu Liu takes the titular role by storm as he navigates this typical hero's journey with charm and composure. Mixing a bit of T'Challa with Tony Stark, Shang-Chi is a hero battling with his past and future. Liu and Cretton strike a great balance as Liu hands himself over to Cretton's material in the somber moments, and Cretton lets Liu's comedic instincts light up the room.

Veteran Tony Leung brings the same melancholic energy to Wenwu as he did in his roles with Wong Kar-wai, particularly his work in ""In the Mood for Love."" Leung layers this villain and distances him from the average world dominator. He carries a stillness about him that inspires fear and compassion, two things that have made some of the greatest villains.

The overall narrative within a Marvel film is evenly composed of the plot and the action. Thankfully, Cretton blends both those halves together as he imbues the setpieces with the qualities of the wuxia genre, taking after such films as Ang Lee's ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" (also starring Michelle Yeoh) and Zhang Yimou's ""House of Flying Daggers."" The action often tells as much of the story as the dialogue, particularly in the gracefully dazzling opening sequence. But there's also room for brutality as the first act ends with a tower-scaffolding brawl where Shang-Chi's emotions turn him into a raw killer. Not since ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" has the action been so impactful on a technical and emotional level.

When allowed to be its own film, ""Shang-Chi"" is quite the spectacle. But when it gets forcefully molded into a Marvel film, the results are less than stellar. Even after all his work with the story and action, Cretton can't break free from the third-act visual effects extravaganza that holds this franchise like an iron vice. It's a shame as the smaller familial moments do more for the mind and soul than the forgettable litany of explosions that encompass the final thirty minutes. Being that this is the 25th film in the franchise, I've come to expect that level of disappointment.

Thanks to its multi-talented cast and crew, ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" is one of the better origin stories within the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The action may (rightfully) be the selling point, but the heart of the film lies within its characters, telling a familiar story on an impressive scale.","For nearly ten years after its inception, the Marvel Cinematic Universe was dominated by the adventures of white men. Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow had to fight to get her own film this year, while her male co-stars got entire trilogies . ""Black Panther"" reinvigorated the franchise with its celebration of African culture in 2018, proving that the Marvel brand didn't have to be so beige. ""Captain Marvel"" became the first MCU film to be fronted by a woman. Now, ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" marks the first Asian-led film. Not only does the film feature the first Asian protagonist, it also features a predominantly Asian cast and crew, which, thankfully, give this franchise a much needed change in perspective.

The Ten Rings have been around for nearly a thousand years, gifting their wearer, Wenwu, immortality so that he may rule with unmatched strength. After centuries of building an empire out of blood, Wenwu was turned away from a life of violence by Ying Li, a guardian of the mystical land of Ta Lo. When heartbreak struck shortly after, Wenwu picked up the rings once again, causing him to go down a dark path, and his son, Shang-Chi, to run away to the United States. Now after ten years, the son must come home to confront his father and become who he was truly meant to be.

Similar to what Ryan Coogler was able to do with ""Black Panther"", co-writer/director Destin Daniel Cretton brings out the best of this new world as he is able to handle the mountains of establishing exposition. His use of flashbacks may be a bit liberal, especially as the film reaches its climax, but they're used meaningfully to build upon a story focused on character and culture.

Without a leading acting credit to his name, Simu Liu takes the titular role by storm as he navigates this typical hero's journey with charm and composure. Mixing a bit of T'Challa with Tony Stark, Shang-Chi is a hero battling with his past and future. Liu and Cretton strike a great balance as Liu hands himself over to Cretton's material in the somber moments, and Cretton lets Liu's comedic instincts light up the room.

Veteran Tony Leung brings the same melancholic energy to Wenwu as he did in his roles with Wong Kar-wai, particularly his work in ""In the Mood for Love."" Leung layers this villain and distances him from the average world dominator. He carries a stillness about him that inspires fear and compassion, two things that have made some of the greatest villains.

The overall narrative within a Marvel film is evenly composed of the plot and the action. Thankfully, Cretton blends both those halves together as he imbues the setpieces with the qualities of the wuxia genre, taking after such films as Ang Lee's ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" (also starring Michelle Yeoh) and Zhang Yimou's ""House of Flying Daggers."" The action often tells as much of the story as the dialogue, particularly in the gracefully dazzling opening sequence. But there's also room for brutality as the first act ends with a tower-scaffolding brawl where Shang-Chi's emotions turn him into a raw killer. Not since ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" has the action been so impactful on a technical and emotional level.

When allowed to be its own film, ""Shang-Chi"" is quite the spectacle. But when it gets forcefully molded into a Marvel film, the results are less than stellar. Even after all his work with the story and action, Cretton can't break free from the third-act visual effects extravaganza that holds this franchise like an iron vice. It's a shame as the smaller familial moments do more for the mind and soul than the forgettable litany of explosions that encompass the final thirty minutes. Being that this is the 25th film in the franchise, I've come to expect that level of disappointment.

Thanks to its multi-talented cast and crew, ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" is one of the better origin stories within the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The action may (rightfully) be the selling point, but the heart of the film lies within its characters, telling a familiar story on an impressive scale."

1097,1097,Thrilling & Funny,"This movie gave me hope that there are still bright days ahead for the MCU. Shang-Chi is very different from what we've seen in the past but it's so good. It's visually stunning and the action sequences are thrilling. It had the quality of action that I was expecting from Black Panther. The ten rings are fascinating to watch in use. There were such epic moments that I had to rewind and watch again a few times. I really wish I could have seen this is IMAX. It's one of the few movies that would have been a truly special experience.

With a story like this one, things could have very easily taken a downward turn into the realm of cheesiness and over the top. But it's all done so well. The comedy and serious moments are balanced really well. There are some real laugh out loud moments but the movie never feels silly. The back-flashes are interesting and meaningful.

One of my favorite surprises of this movie, is that it redeems the worst villain twist of the MCU. You know Marvel and Disney have done well when we look forward to seeing these new characters in the future.","This movie gave me hope that there are still bright days ahead for the MCU.

1104,1104,Precious ... ten times,"Of course I am just riffing off, teasing and making fun of certain things with my summary line. Though there is some truth in there too - especially if you consider the last third of the movie - quite fantastical, pun intended.

But there is so much more here. And while you may have seen the bus scene already (I imagine many times), it still is quite the highlight and works wonders! Because there is even more to it than the trailer/teaser revealed! As is with the plot and the characters of the movie.

I was able to watch it on an Imax screen and let me tell you ... wow! But also wow and much respect to Marvel and Feige and anyone involved that they dared to make the first ten minutes or so in chinese! And throwing a lot of chinese terms (slang?) in there as well - throughout! That gives it a touch of authenticity. How immigrants in America or anywhere else in the world grew up. I do the same with my Greek and German/English.

It is also nice and while I am prone to be sarcastic, I really think it's a good thing to have such a major and big representation - especially nowadays with Anti-Asian hate/crime rising. All because of people blaming China and people of China for a virus ... the movie does not have that as a topic, it is entertainment after all, but in every promo and interview that the actors were involved it was something that was mentioned. Good for them and good for us, that this was made.

I am a bit biased when it comes to the MCU and this did get a pure theatrical release, instead of the Black Widow treatment (which also was available on Disney plus and the cinemas at the same time). So there is not issue when it comes to that. And if you can watch it on the big screen - you will not be dissapointed! Now waiting for the other stuff to drop ... especially after the mid credit scene, that is such a tease ... the after the credits scene might also hint at something, but the bigger tease was midway through the credits (actually almost at the beginning of them to be honest).

Sit back and enhoy the movie and the really funny characters ... and quite a few familiar faces. Some from the MCU and previous entries but also some from Asian cinema!

1106,1106,Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,,
1107,1107,The best Marvel movie so far...,"Having seen the trailer for the 2021 Marvel action movie ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" I must admit that of course I was going to watch it, but I feared it would just be another run-of-the-mill-over-the-top-CGI-fest-but-barred-of-proper-contents Marvel movie. Yet, I opted to sit down and watch it, on the notion that it was a Marvel movie. But also because of the cast that starred in it.

And yeah, this movie was over the top in terms of CGI. Of course it was, because it is a Marvel movie after all. But luckily this movie broke the formula of the archetypical Marvel movie and this actually turned out to be the best Marvel movie so far. Well, at least in my opinion. Why? Well, because of the storyline and the fact that it mixed Asian culture and lore into the Marvel cinematic universe, and it was a much needed addition to an otherwise Western-focused series of movies.

The storyline told in ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"", as written by Dave Callaham, Destin Daniel Cretton and Andrew Lanham was certainly entertaining. And the movie didn't really have a dull moment, despite the fact that it was a movie that ran for 132 minutes. I thoroughly enjoyed the entire movie from beginning to end. And for me, this was a storyline with proper contents to it, that also included interesting characters and creatures.

Visually then ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" blew me away. The CGI team really worked their magic with this movie and brought it to life in a very visually fulfilling way. Lots of nice details and jaw-dropping special effects. And the creature designs in the movie were off the charts, I really enjoyed seeing those brought to life on the screen.

The character gallery in ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" was interesting, and that applies for both the villain and good guy side.

And they had such a great cast ensemble put together for ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"", with the likes of Asian cinema heavy weighters such as Tony Chiu-Wai Leung, Michelle Yeoh and Wah Yuen. But the movie was also nicely carried by Simu Liu, whom I was not familiar with prior to this movie. And also having Awkwafina in the movie was just brilliant, because she put on a spot on performance with her comedy sidekick character. And it was interesting and nice to see Ben Kingsley return to reprise his character of Trevor Slattery.

""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" is a good combination of action and narrative storytelling, which made for a very wholesome movie. And it should be said that the action sequences were breathtaking to behold, so very, very nicely choreographed and executed on the screen, taking that traditional Wuxia elements seen in Asian movies and mixing it in with the archetypical Marvel Western-based superhero movies.

I was more than genuinely entertained by ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" and it is certainly a movie that bolsters Marvel's hold for me, as their movies tend to be super flashy with spectacular effects, but rather hollow in terms of proper entertainment and storytelling.

My rating of ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" lands on a well-deserved nine out of ten stars.

1109,1109,Ten Years too Late,,
1110,1110,Indeed legendary,"It's been ten years since Shang-Chi(Liu, charming, stoic) last saw his father, and leader of the criminal empire The Ten Rings, Wenwu(Leung, charismatic enough that we feel a lot of empathy for him, even when he does terrible things that we desperately want him to stop doing). That was also when he last spent time with his sister, Xialing(Zhang, a badass who deserves more screen time. Honestly, I'd be very surprised if she didn't, in future projects). He's joined by his friend Katy(Awkwafina, quirky, providing a lot of comic relief, something I'm told she's in general adept at), for what can best be described as a tense reunion, which allows the movie to really mine the family melodrama, one of the best elements it has. I won't give away exactly what the antagonist intends to do, only that our hero has to stop him. However, he has to figure out how, maybe even if, that is even possible.

Not quite, yet almost ""Black Panther for Asian audiences"", this does a lot for representation(including for women. Some of the best characters in this are female. In addition to the two that I've already mentioned, there is also Ying Nan(Yeoh, wise)), it is positively drenched in Chinese culture(the third act, while in ways it feels like it belongs to a completely different film than the first two, takes an especially deep dive into that. Ultimately, it is presented through a Western lens, and clearly we need to go further in this direction, still, it is a big deal that they put so much of it in an estimated $150 to 200 million major blockbuster, which will be seen by millions of people who would never consider watching an art picture, especially one focusing on a group they don't belong to), to the point where countless times, when it makes sense, major characters in this speak Mandarin to each other, rather than English, which it is subtitled into. And ""don't worry"", for those who think that the following is important: there are white people on screen, and they aren't made out to be ""less than"".

The action(each sequence of which feels distinct, belongs with the rest, and is memorable) pays tribute to many different kinds of martial arts films, acknowledging that they are standing on the shoulders of giants. Jackie Chan, wuxia, etc. The choreography is matched in skill by the cinematography. Not only are we seeing incredible fighting, the camera is dynamic, celebrating and highlighting how incredible it is. That *is* why you hire Bill Pope, the director of photography on the Matrix trilogy, two of Sam Raimi's Spider-Man entries, Darkman and Team America. The special effects are excellent. There are some issues with pacing, and certainly a chunk of this is composed almost entirely of flashbacks.

This features relatively brief but highly concentrated, surprisingly graphic gore(you know, there was a time when the fact that it's happening to beings that clearly are not human, wasn't enough to get away with this kind of thing with a PG-13 rating. Pepperidge Farm remembers), as well as a little strong language. I recommend this to any fan of comic book movie adaptations, and people passionate about diversity hiring. 8/10.","It's been ten years since Shang-Chi(Liu, charming, stoic) last saw his father, and leader of the criminal empire The Ten Rings, Wenwu(Leung, charismatic enough that we feel a lot of empathy for him, even when he does terrible things that we desperately want him to stop doing).

1115,1115,A Marvel for the whole family.,"""The US government was almost toppled by a pretender named after an orange."" Wenwu (Tony Leung)

This quote is typical of the light-hearted but also serious addition to the MCU that is Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings. Although Marvel has always been less serious than DC, this time it leaves Superman and Batman to cry in their capes. Sweet superhero Sean/Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) has more humanity than almost any other hero, and he uses his martial arts only when pressed.

The opening sequence on a bus (you can see the bad coming from other cinematic bus rides such as in Nobody) is rousing and entertaining. It has a fight sequence I laughed through because of its ballet-like composition but satisfying because it sets up character and motivation.

When things get heavy, and they do because Sean must confront and potentially kill his 1000-year-old mobster dad, Wenwu, Awkwafina's Katy, Sean's girlfriend, is there with amusing one-liners throughout the adventure, right down to a life-saving shot in the big ending battle scene.

Director Destin Daniel Cretton deftly orchestrates his fights and his characters' lines with the authority of a much more seasoned filmmaker. He never loses sight of the central motif-the affirmation of family primacy, so that the potential chaos of a giant cast and multiple plot strands hosts a unity glued by character and dialogue.

When things get heavy, and they do because Sean must confront and potentially kill his 1000-year-old mobster dad, Wenwu, Awkwafina's Katy, Sean's girlfriend, is there with amusing one-liners throughout the adventure, right down to a life-saving shot in the big ending battle scene.

Director Destin Daniel Cretton deftly orchestrates his fights and his characters' lines with the authority of a much more seasoned filmmaker. He never loses sight of the central motif-the affirmation of family primacy, so that the potential chaos of a giant cast and multiple plot strands hosts a unity glued by character and dialogue.

Shang-Chi is a Marvel for the whole family and especially the cinephiles curious how The Marvel Cinematic Universe can be so diverse, so entertaining, and so perfect a purveyor of our heroic fantasies."

1117,1117,The legend of the ten Marvel movies a year for all eternity.,"'Shang-Chi And The Legend Of The Ten Rings (2021)' is, essentially, exactly what you expect it to be. Not only does it feel like a Marvel movie, it feels like a literal Disney movie as well. This is often detrimental to the overall affair, as the piece should have been much more unique than it ultimately is, and it makes for a much less interesting watch overall. However, the formula it follows has provided plenty of success in the past; this time is no exception. Its highs are where you'd expect them to be, as are its lows, and there is an undeniable sense of fun, albeit cookie-cutter fun, to be had. The film is an entertaining action adventure that follows a young man whose criminal father calls him and his sister back home in order to lay siege to the mystical village he believes is holding his wife, the protagonist's mother, hostage. The villain's motivation is a little underexplored yet entirely understandable. It comes from a believable emotional place and is more satisfying because of it. The relationship between the lead and his no-good dad isn't explored as much as it could be, though, and the flick generally has a bit of a theming issue. The piece tries to tie its events directly into the wants and needs of its lead characters, but it does so in an unsatisfyingly half-baked way and honestly would probably have been better if it played itself as more of a straightforward adventure ala most of the 'Mission: Impossible (1996-)' series. Still, the touches of character development are appreciated and each lead player is written to be as likeable as possible. This, combined with the amicable performances, means that you care about the heroes even though you don't have all that much reason to. This keeps you invested in their stories throughout. The highlight of the entire affair is, for sure, its action. For the most part, the picture stays towards the right end of the practical to CG spectrum. The fights are never exactly realistic, per se, but they're based on competent choreography and clean camerawork. They're, more often than not, really entertaining. Sadly, the flick inches closer and closer towards the wrong end of the aforementioned spectrum the longer it goes on. By the time it reaches its finale (which gives me major 'Fast And Furious Presents Hobbs And Shaw (2019)' vibes for some reason), it's clear that the balance it previously achieved is going to go out of the window. Sure enough, its climactic battle is an entirely computer-generated affair; it isn't all that compelling and goes directly against what made the movie so enjoyable to begin with. No matter how hard it tries to disguise it, it still ends with a big blue beam in the sky. Still, the finale isn't exactly bad. It's just annoyingly intangible and feels a little forced in, even (as do the rather cringe-worthy post-credits scenes). Ultimately, this is a generic yet entertaining experience. Its charming acting and exciting action are clearly its highlights, and its weakest aspects are still decent enough. It's a good movie. However, I can't deny that Marvel fatigue is becoming more and more pertinent in my mind. You know what you're going to get before you get it. Plus, the studio's insistence that it has to perforate every single outing with references to other, almost entirely irrelevant fare is really annoying. Although most of their movies are at least okay, I find myself not caring at all about them. That's sad, really, considering that the MCU has produced some genuinely great pictures in the past. 7/10.","'Shang-Chi And The Legend Of The Ten Rings (2021)' is, essentially, exactly what you expect it to be.

1118,1118,Fun martial arts action-comedy with some dragon ex machina,"After a flashback, this movie jumps to a couple of slackers, Shaun and Katy, with Shaun proving during a wild bus ride that he is much more than a car attendant. Soon they're on a globe hoping adventure with world-saving dimensions.

The martial arts choreography is terrific, from the opening forest fight through that fantastic bus bit to the final hand-to-hand battle (followed by the big special effects battle seemingly required in every Marvel film). Fights are funny and exciting and that final battle is truly suspenseful.

The cast is also excellent. Awkwafina is as funny as ever, Michelle Yeoh and Tony Leung bring all their seasoned expertise to their roles, and the actors are don't know are also first rate.

Although ... in the case of Simu Liu, who plays Shaun/Shang-Chi, I have no strong opinion. He's a pleasant every man who handles the action scenes well but seems less mythic hero than ""genial best friend of the main character."" With all the other talent on screen he doesn't manage to leave much of an impression, but on the bright side I don't object to him.

The story is fun, the movie does a good job of mixing humor, action, and tragical reminiscences the pace is terrific, and man there are some great fights.

1119,1119,my eyes couldn't handle the sheer awesomeness on the screen,"Watch this in IMAX!!!! The entire movie has an expanded aspect ratio. You're watching about 70% of the image on normal screens, plus on way smaller screens with worse speakers. I promise, it's worth it

WOWOWOWOWOW. This movie blew me away. I love it. A LOT. From beginning to end. Everything. I walked out of the movie so hyped, silent-screaming under my mask as i walked to the car. It's been a while since i walked out of a movie this happy. I have so much to say.

I love the MCU (a lot), but there are a few things that are frequently lacking. One of them is good fight scenes. They always have awesome action scenes, but specifically fight scenes are usually pretty good, only great in a few movies like civil war and winter soldier. And in general, fight scenes in American movies pale in comparison to Asian cinema (Ip man, The Raid Redemption, anything Jackie Chan).

The fight scenes in this movie.... how do i describe it... amazing martial arts that's fast but clear, filmed in creative and astonishing ways without a hint of shaky cam or quick cuts, against stunningly beautiful backdrops... phenomenal. And they continuously focus on the fights instead of cutting to a different scene after 10 seconds like i've noticed in the MCU.

This is BY FAR the best fighting in the MCU and it's not even close. Has to be up there with the John Wick series and Netflix's Daredevil as some of the best we've seen in America lately. I loved the first major fight scene so much that i was worried it would be the best one of the movie, far too early. Lol. I be stupid sometimes

Another frequent flaw in the MCU is lack of compelling villain. Nope. Awesome awesome awesome. That's all i'll say.

Another of my frequent complaints is that the musical scores, with some exceptions, don't stand out. I think they heard. They're on a good streak with the shows and Black Widow. It's not as amazing as the Loki score but i liked it. It felt unique to this new franchise.

Still so much more to say, need to go faster. This is one of the best, maybe THE best, story in the MCU, especially the way it's told. I loved all the characters, i loved all the casting choices, i loved the performances. There are scenes of dialogue that gave me goosebumps. All the emotional moments hit. All the callbacks hit. There isn't anything that didn't work for me. There's no such thing as a perfect movie, but mannnnnn.

Lmao i didn't mention the cinematography. Why would i wait this long? It's MESMERIZING. A lot. Throughout. It's candy for your eyes.

It's also nice to see well-written comedy with jokes relevant to the scene and characters, that feels organic. As opposed to the ""insert joke here"" method we've been seeing more of, especially in Far From Home.

What's the opposite of formulaic? That's this movie. I never knew what to expect next (helps that i didn't watch a single trailer, they ruin movies). Definitely doesn't feel like a typical MCU movie. It has it's own unique tone and feel and character.

Continuing what i said in my headline, i have this thing where i get goosebumps and start tearing up, not from an emotional moment, but from a scene being so incredible, especially action scenes. Don't know why it happens, don't know if it happens to other ppl. Maybe it's partly because i can't risk blinking. That happened in this movie numerous times. Like ""this is the coolest thing i've ever seen in my life."" hyperbole, but mannnnn

after endgame finished phase 3 (yes i know spider-man), i was so happy and satisfied with the MCU. But i wasn't sure they could ever recapture that magic again. I knew i would watch everything and it would probably mostly be awesome. But i wasn't expecting top-tier stuff any more. Lol. I be stupid sometimes. I am ecstatic to have that notion obliterated. As of now, this is a top 6 MCU movie for me. Wow

All in all, i adore this movie. You may wonder why i wouldn't give it a 10 after all this raving. 10s are super rare for me, only 13 of them, and i watch thousands of movies. Interstellar, inception, mad max fury road, etc. Movies that shouldn't even be called movies. My 9s are rare too, they are my favorite movies. 10s are my favorites of my favorites. Only superhero movies i've given 10s are dark knight, dark knight rises and civil war.

If you're still reading, wow you're awesome! I think this is my longest review other than Interstellar.

I'm still in such a good mood. I can't wait to watch it again, in IMAX. I want to wait a week so it feels fresher, but i might not be able to!

1129,1129,Shang Empty,"Sorry for the delay.

Here we go...

I'm not feeling this movie. It starts with promise but It lost me after Wong vs Abomb.

The fighting is exciting. The movie lacks excitement though. It's a plain dull movie.

It's about a Karate master and... yeah the movie lost me and I have know idea what it's about. This is the first mcu film that I lost interest for midway. Even Im3 wasn't so bad because I lost interest from the very beginning.

Gotg2, mcu Spiderman 1/2 and IM3 are still the worse in mcu. Shang Chi just joined the club.

A movie so full of emptiness that it makes an empty box jealous

I'm not sure how this is a 7. Fans and the average movie goer should also be held responsible for horrible movies.

This movie ain't a 7 even if you watched this movie as blind and drunk.

They tried to be funny by having Wong be rude by drinking the couple's drink at the end credit scene. That wasn't funny at all. Wizard or not.

Speaking of funny, I didn't laugh once. When I used to watch these movies in theatres, the audience often told me when I should have laughed. I watched it at home, therefore I didn't know my cue of when to laugh.

The mcu needs to chill with the daddy issue plot

THOR Loki daddy issue Black Panta daddy issues Stark Daddy issues Star lord Daddy issues Ultron daddy issues Nebula and Gamora daddy issues Shang daddy issue Wasp daddy issues Scott langs daughter Daddy issues

Gotg2, mcu Spiderman 1/2 and IM3 are still the worse in mcu. Shang Chi just joined the club.

A movie so full of emptiness that it makes an empty box jealous

I'm not sure how this is a 7. Fans and the average movie goer should also be held responsible for horrible movies.

This movie ain't a 7 even if you watched this movie as blind and drunk.

They tried to be funny by having Wong be rude by drinking the couple's drink at the end credit scene. That wasn't funny at all. Wizard or not.

Speaking of funny, I didn't laugh once. When I used to watch these movies in theatres, the audience often told me when I should have laughed. I watched it at home, therefore I didn't know my cue of when to laugh.

The mcu needs to chill with the daddy issue plot

THOR Loki daddy issue Black Panta daddy issues Stark Daddy issues Star lord Daddy issues Ultron daddy issues Nebula and Gamora daddy issues Shang daddy issue Wasp daddy issues Scott langs daughter Daddy issues

No one has mommy issues.

Don't watch this movie."
1130,1130,Masterpiece...,"""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" is an Action - Fantasy movie in which we watch a new era of Marvel Studios rise with Shang-Chi, the master of Kung Fu. He has to face his past involving him with the Ten Rings organization and crate his future accordingly.

I have to admit that I had my doubts about this movie but I was proven very wrong since it's an amazing movie. It has a beautiful and very interesting plot that keeps you in tense through its whole duration consisted of plenty of action and nice CGIs. For one more time Marvel succeeded on creating a nice atmosphere and connecting the previous movies with this one with many Easter Eggs so, we expect more in the near future. The interpretation of Simu Liu who played as Shaun / Shang-Chi was simply outstanding and he made the difference. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Tony Chiu-Wai Leung's who played as Xu Wenwu, Michelle Yeoh's who played as Ying Nan, Meng'er Zhang's who played as Xialing and Awkwafina's who played as Katy. The comic relief role of Ben Kingsley as Trevor Slattery was a brilliant idea that also gave something different in the movie. Finally, I have to say that ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" is an amazing movie and I strongly recommend everyone to watch it, especially the fans of Marvel.","""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" is an Action - Fantasy movie in which we watch a new era of Marvel Studios rise with Shang-Chi, the master of Kung Fu.

1136,1136,"Epic, stunning, and a strong powerhouse story.","5 out of 5 stars.

Shang-Chi and the legend of the Ten Rings is an awesome and exciting mcu film that brings the stunning world with the asian culture. I will say i enjoyed this more than the previous mcu film Black Widow. Shang Chi introduces a new mcu character played by Simu Liu. And Awkwafina which is also a fun addition. While they are being chased by an organization called ten rings. Lead by his father Tony Leung. While Shang Chi learns his abilities and the ten rings. Before his father is trying to use that power for a personal reason.

Great epic plot. Shang Chi and Katy (Awkwafina) enter a hidden world Ta Lao where there is magical mythical creatures. Is like a wow stunning moment when you first see Wakanda in Black Panther. The film does give an emotional story build up and a villain that can be relatable.

The cast ensemble is great. Simu Liu did great with the character along with Awkwafina as his friend. Meng'er Zhang, Michelle Yeoh, Benedict Wong, Florian Munteanu, and Tong Leung all did great.

The set designs and visual effects are stunning and great. Can be colorful at moments. The music score was good as well. The action sequences are great and exciting. Every set piece had an awesome martial arts choreography which was well shot with the cinematography. Director did a great job in capturing the action and fight sequences. Even with the epic climax of the dragon battle.

There are two mid and post credit scene which sets up for further films and has a fun nod to the mcu.

I will say Shang Chi is a great exciting addition and i found the film to be very fast moving. Action packed. And a great family conflict story that is emotionally driven.","5 out of 5 stars.

1137,1137,A Marvel-ous martial arts joy,"Showing no signs of slowing down hot off the heels of Black Widow, a raft of well-received Disney+ series and arriving not too far in front of the hotly anticipated The Eternals, Marvel continues to put in work that puts many other wheelhouses too shame, with the marital arts infused Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, yet another entry into the brands increasingly loaded catalogue of quality blockbuster releases.

It's hard to pinpoint exactly what Marvel keep doing to maintain the momentum that started all those years ago with 2008's Iron Man, it's absolutely correct when many say a lot of these origin stories and event pictures follow a very set formula from A to B, but with an ability to attract some of the best actors working in the industry today and handpicking a raft of some of the most exciting Hollywood filmmakers around, Marvel have once more struck gold with the incredibly fun and inventive Shang-Chi.

Quite possibly the most visually sumptuous Marvel film yet, sometimes feeling as if Marvel has meet with Ang Lee/Yimou Zhang and in my mind the Marvel film that features the best choregraphed action scenes yet from the spectacle heavy brand, Shang-Chi is a big screen blast that is freshly directed by the upcoming Destin Daniel Cretton who here has got his just rewards after his great debut Short Term 12 and the sadly undervalued The Glass Castle came before this big-budgeted ride.

Infusing his film with a great energy and charm that is enhanced by the work of leads Simu Liu (in a career launching turn) as our likable hero Shaun/Shang-Chi, Awkwafina (doing her usual but fun schtick) as Shaun's bestie Katy and Tony Leung as the unfortunate villain of the piece Xu Wenwu, Cretton has turned out to be the perfect choice to start off the cinematic journey of the fist swinging Shang-Chi and helps instill in his film some nice differences to what we've come to expect from comic book blockbusters of the modern era.

Most notably for the film is the exciting use of hand to hand combat that is delivered spectacularly in two stand out sequences on board a moving bus and then bettered alongside a high rise building in Macau, both these set pieces are easily some of the most noteworthy of any Marvel film yet while also benefiting the film other than its Asian infused eccentricities is the fun relationship between Shang-Chi and Katy than never bothers with adding extra baggage to add weight to their believable and fun friendship.

If there was a major drawback to Shang-Chi's many wins it is in an overdrawn finale, a major problem many have acknowledged previously when it comes to Marvel films, Cretton and his team can't quite stick the landing for Shang-Chi with it being a little too long in the tooth for its own good and slightly overblown and while it features some incredible imagery and technical wizardry, the films rip-roaring start and strong middle section gives way too something lesser.

Final Say -

Another huge win for Marvel who have here with the help of director Destin Daniel Cretton and his talented cast, created an instantly likable cinematic universe that provides the comic kings with one of their most unique and exciting playgrounds yet.

The movie is good and I like the casting. The direction is okay but the cinematography is the best.

The ending is anti climatic. I found it to be cliche. However it is worth the watch.

1139,1139,Yet another superb stand-alone superhero flick in MCEU's kitty.,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (2021) : Brief Review -

Yet another superb stand-alone superhero flick in MCEU's kitty. MCEU's new phase never looked so promising but their products are delivering Better than expected. That Spider Man flick in 2019, right after Endgame, changed many perceptions about Marvel's future and even though couple of their recent series like 'Wanda Vision' and 'Loki' couldn't emerge as clear winners, they have set a solid base for upcoming new stories. Shang-Chi is a new start by all means. Not only because it comes under new phase but mainly because it is a stand-alone film and with a new superhero who is more like using traditional combat methods along with ancient superpowers. When Captain America or Black Panther begun as Stand-alone films, they promised too much and thankfully fulfilled it. Shang-Chi does the same. It may not promise too much like Steve Rogers and Wakanda stories but the point where it ends surely gives us hints of new assembled version of superheroes in Multiverse. Shang-Chi, the master of unarmed weaponry-based Kung Fu, is forced to confront his past after being drawn into the Ten Rings organization. The film has major portion covered by Family values and hence, it may look predictable but does not bore at all. Yes, few scenes are outdated and too dramatic as if we are watching a Superhero Film made in 90s but let's just forget those weak points as Shang Chi has excelled in Visual spectacle. The screenplay could have been better in the second half when the big War was supposed to take place but it actually looks tiny one except for those two humongous dragons which might remind you of 'The Hobbit'. Performances by Simu Li, Awkwafina, Meng'er Zhang, Fala Chen, Florian Munteanu are fine according to less potential available for the roles. Actually, the humour and tone of these characters was great. They all looked normal people when they were not fighting and even though the film has ancient refrences, the character don't actually go too deep to become expressive. Director Destin Daniel Cretton seemed slightly off track in the beginning when he tries to humanise all the characters with that typically teenage humor but as the film goes ahead, he recovers from the childish entanglement. With super explosive climax he surely makes up for his mistakes, rather makes us forgive it. Overall, Shang Chi is another superb entertainer for Marvel Fanboys and even neutrals are gonna enjoy it.

RATING - 7/10*

1140,1140,This could've been great if it wasn't for the cheesy writing.,"The story was riddled with holes and plot issues. Since when does Awkwafina's pedestrian character all of a sudden get invited to become part of the MCU team? What's her super power... stupidity? Don't get me wrong, I love her, but her character was lazily written. Then there's the whole daddy issues dynamic - Shang is with him, then against, then with etc.. Then we have these ridiculous dragons fighting, where one scores some power crystals and becomes stronger! This is just infantile lazy writing. There was zero shock value or anything spectacular in the entire runtime, with tedious long middle acts and a bumbling third act. The jokes were cliched and not funny. The funniest parts were Ben Kingsley's character, (of whom was in this for what reasons??) and the ending to go Karaoke - which was the only time I actually cracked a chuckle. You'd think with three writers we'd have something cohesive and coherent. But instead of a Marvel superhero story, we got a Disney evil vs good with dragons thrown into the mix. It's as if they tried too hard to create the Asian version of Black Panther.

It's a shame, because the directing and cinematography were spot on, and great S/VFX - although a little overboard with the CGI i.e. Dragons. The martial arts choreography was outstanding (although again, overboard after the awesome bus scene), and the casting and performances were excellent, especially Leung, who pretty much carried the film on his shoulders. It's a 7/10 from me.","The story was riddled with holes and plot issues. Since when does Awkwafina's pedestrian character all of a sudden get invited to become part of the MCU team?

1141,1141,8 Rings out of 10,"For the first time in a couple of years, since 2019's ""Captain Marvel"" the MCU introduces us to a brand new hero. Simu Liu who, rather impressively, first asked for the role on Twitter brings us Shang-Chi in a film that perhaps does have some issues with it's ending, but ultimately is a fun, funny ride of the type Marvel have been perfecting for the last 13 years.

Talented, but somewhat aimless, Shaun (Simu Liu) lives in San Francisco working as a valet with his friend Katy (Awkwafina). When he's attacked on a bus, he's forced back into the world of his father, a ruthless terrorist Xu Wenwu (Tony Chiu-Wai Leung). First visiting his sister, then returning to the Ten Rings compound, Shang-Chi decides to use his skills to defend his late mothers sacred homeland against invasion from his father and for control of ten mystical arm rings, weapons that grant their owner immortality and unearthly power.

If ""Black Widow"" was considered a wobble for the MCU, despite the fact I thought that it's a perfectly fine film, then it was important to come back with something that was undeniably excellent. ""Shang-Chi"" was that. It's the perfect balance of humour and action that Marvel have established over the last few years. The action too is tweaked slightly, to more closely resemble the types of Asian led action films that we've seen previously, be that the Jackie Chan style bus fight, or the ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon""-esque flashback fight between Shang Chi's parents. There's some lovely links to the wider MCU, including a return for Benedict Wong's Wong and for Trevor Slattery, Ben Kingsley's ""Iron Man 3"" character whose masquerading role as The Mandarin was one of the MCU's most divisive moments.

It's not perfect. The ending is perhaps a little rushed and lacking a moment or two of redemption earning for Xu Wenwu, but the peaks at the future for the character, and for the 10 Rings organisation is an interesting addition, plus our first real step on what might be the route to the next big bad. Excellent stuff.","For the first time in a couple of years, since 2019's ""Captain Marvel"" the MCU introduces us to a brand new hero.

Much fighting ensues but fortunately everyone eventually learns how to 'get along' when faced with a real threat. You have seen it all before: physics-defying martial arts, monsters who look like the recently swallowed strings of LED Christmas lights, conflicted heroes with wise-cracking 'comic relief' sidekicks (an awful Aquafina and an even more awful Ben Kingsley), giant melees featuring a variety of glowing weapons (but no blood), hyper-kinetic and hyper-implausible car/motorcycle chases, and a lot of clichéd wisecracks, tough-guy dialogue, poseur slo-mo, and heroic vogueing (we're treated to the venerable three-point power landing/slide a number of times). The only novel thing the film has to offer is the excellent rendering of mythological beasts from Chinese culture; otherwise, it's an overly-long (132 minutes, which is 120 minutes too much Aquafina), derivative, repetitive, and ultimately boring entry in the bloated, jejune Micky Mouse-Marvel superhero franchise.","Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) discovers that his all-powerful and millennium-old father is about to launch an attack against the magical village where Shang-Chi's mother was born in the likely mistaken belief that his wife is not dead but is rather being held captive (there is more to the plot than one sentence can sum up but what does it matter... the story is just scaffolding for the special effects).

1145,1145,Promises good things for MCU's Phase Four,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings stars Simu Liu in the lead role alongside such heavy names as Tony Leung and Michelle Yeoh in this latest installment to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Liu's Shang-Chi must come to his own as the son of the legendary Mandarin (Leung), the owner of the Ten Rings.

I like this film's style most of all. Director Destin Daniel Cretton mixes Chinese wuxia settings and aesthetics with Hong Kong wire kung fu inspired action set pieces, while still keeping it feeling like a Marvel film. There's a surprising amount of callbacks and nods to the larger Marvel universe, pleasing dedicated fans, but the film is still able to stand on its own feet and introduce us to its hero.

Kudos also to the whole filming for these action scenes. Very little shaky cam or jump cuts, especially for the hand to hand scenes. Exactly as it should be. I'd dare to say that this film has some of, if not the best action set pieces in all of MCU.

One of the most thrilling and visually spectacular end battles as well, come to think of it.

Furthermore, the acting is solid, especially from Liu, Leung and Awkwafina, who plays Shang-Chi's American friend. Meng'er Zhang as Xialing, Shang-Chi's younger sister, was perhaps my only real gripe with the film. I could have used either a bit more edge to her or alternatively a lot less. Now she seemed to flipflop between relatable and aggravating.

All in all, not the best Marvel movie by any means, but that's a really high bar to clear. I can simply say that based on this, I'm very optimistic about MCU's continued future.","Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings stars Simu Liu in the lead role alongside such heavy names as Tony Leung and Michelle Yeoh in this latest installment to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Liu's Shang-Chi must come to his own as the son of the legendary Mandarin (Leung), the owner of the Ten Rings.

I like this film's style most of all. Director Destin Daniel Cretton mixes Chinese wuxia settings and aesthetics with Hong Kong wire kung fu inspired action set pieces, while still keeping it feeling like a Marvel film.

1146,1146,The Master of kung fu was really good but not as good as I wanted it to be.,"It was better than the proceeding Marvel movie Black Window. More exceeding the expectations of a Marvel movie. Shang-Chi feels like the marvel movie experience is starting to get back to the normal of the theme ride Martian Scorsese believes they are (I can't disagree, just note that's what I want)

In comparison Shang-Chi is a lower level character. I am a fan of Marvel comics but got more of the references to the Marvel Cinematic Universe in this movie than to the direct comic book references. Those Marvel cinematic universe references were amazing enough to get over the fact that the obvious comic book ones went over my head. I mean this movie's connection to other movies is great fanfare that makes me love it more. So really cool cameos happen that actually move the story along.

I did like what they did with the Mandarin here but do feel they copied and paste a lot of things into the story of Shang-Chi to make a complete movie for a lower level character. From the little I know of the character he more fits into those Netflix's shows they did a few years back but change him enough to justify a blockbuster.

They did succeed in making Shang-Chi's background more fuller. The relationship between him and his father and sister was beautiful, complex and more importantly, never bored me and of course Awkafina as the comedy relief and best friend to Shang-Chi was strategic gold. The story for the background was not that full. It's really a character driven movie for without the amazing performances from a group of actors who know their stuff this story would fall short.

Note, I loved the fact that Michelle Yeoh was in this movie and that gives it a lot, but she's done way better in less effective films (but she most likely got a huge paycheck from Disney just to wave her hands around).

The special effects were good in this flick. I was impress with what was used to make the final conflict and I was convince that the dude from Kim's Convenience was a master of kung fu

Its a good movie but it did not live up to my high expectations of it. It gave me a lot of cool things but really did not give me anything I did not see before, in movies that did it better, but if it's about anything I did spend the rest of the day pretending I knew Kung fu.","It was better than the proceeding Marvel movie Black Window.

1148,1148,Finally a new kind of marvel story,,
1149,1149,An easy watch that fits into the MCU well,"A San Francisco valet finds his past catching up with him in spectacular fashion.

This is an entertaining superhero adventure story with an Asian martial arts theme and a number of entertaining scenes.

Like many introductions to superhero characters there is a bit of backstory to go through and this film does it with flashback sequences in a similar way to 'Black Panther'. These are mixed with the action, humour and unfolding narrative of the present day plot. Additionally there is some important exposition added relating to the Marvel multiverse. Personally I think everything depicted could have been done in more than one movie, and not so rushed, but that's just a personal preference. What is presented is not complicated in anyway, but very simplified, presumably so that it can be established quickly and the likes of Shang-Chi and Katy can share screens with other MCU characters as soon as possible.

The tone and general feel of the movie also reminds me of the approach taken with 'Black Panther', particularly when it focusses on a location that, like Wakanda, mixes the sights and sounds of regional culture with the sci-fi fantasy. It has obviously been written carefully so that it displays imagery associated with far-Eastern culture like martial arts, traditional costuming, rural settings, that is marketable to a Western audience, but at the same time it avoids other commonly associated negative stereotyping like exaggerated accents, sorcery, yellow peril, bad driving, and (thankfully) gong sounds. Much of this is drenched with a liberal amount of fast-talking contemporary American humour.

There are a number of highly enjoyable scenes such as the fight sequence on the bus, the various comedy moments, virtually everything that comes out of Ben Kingsley's mouth, and all the flashback scenes. The final dinner table scene is probably my favourite.

Visually as you can imagine it is beautiful and full of top drawer cinematography, editing, and technology-driven effects. For me though the spectacle goes over-the-top, particularly in the final action sequence.

Most actors are solid such as Simu Liu, Tony Leung, Meng'er Zhang, Michelle Yeoh, Fala Chen, and Benedict Wong. The standout performances for me easily are Nora Lum and Ben Kingsley who have buckets of charisma and the advantage of all the best lines.

Overall there is little to criticise, it just feels like what Martin Scorsese described perfectly in 2019 as a theme park rather than cinema.","A San Francisco valet finds his past catching up with him in spectacular fashion.

1155,1155,Marvel Sprinkles a Different Flavor into the MCU,"Marvel gets mystical in this mashup of the plucky, familiar MCU character and the more stoic, legend-heavy air of wuxia films. It's a fresh mix, effectively breaking the gravity of its more serious moments with a well-timed jape while lending credence and lore to a lesser-known corner of the comic kingdom, but these crossover moments sometimes test their limits. I could see more grounded viewers being turned off by the dragons and soul-sucking demons (far cry from the feasible reality of the first Iron Man, that) while serious fans of Chinese fantasy are bucked by the constant injection of loose wit and slappy one-liners.

When it's rolling, Shang Chi does manage to toe that line and deliver something appropriately new and versatile, a good reflection of both worlds. It benefits from a tight pair of central performances (Simu Liu and Awkwafina as a team of underachieving twenty-somethings) and several big, powerful action sets (the articulated bus fight might be one of the best combat scenes Marvel's ever put out) while tying in a dangling thread or two from earlier films to provide a sense of greater connection. On several occasions, however, it's guilty of being too self-indulgent and losing the narrative. It's great to see Ben Kingsley again, adding nuance to his part in Iron Man 3, but his scenes are the main offender here; excessive and distracting and way too cute.

The action is strong, the dialogue (mostly) works, the scenery looks great, but in the big picture, Shang Chi feels small-scale and disposable. Non-completionists won't miss anything crucial if they choose to skip it.","Marvel gets mystical in this mashup of the plucky, familiar MCU character and the more stoic, legend-heavy air of wuxia films.

1158,1158,Marvel movie by the numbers with beautiful dragons and charming locations,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is yet another movie inspired by the Marvel universe that has constantly been inspiring the cinematic world for more than a decade now. While the movie follows the usual stereotypes, it manages to stand out with its stunning special effects and locations.

The movie revolves around Shaun, a Chinese immigrant living in the United States of America who is working as a valet with his quirky friend and soulmate Katy. One day, they get attacked by a group of assassins on a bus and only just manage to survive. Shaun immediately understands that the attack must be related to his influential estranged father. Along with Katy, he decides to team up with his tough estranged sister Xialing to find out what's going on.

This film convinces on multiple levels. First of all, the acting performances are quite quirky and convincing. Especially the ladies steal the show. Awkwafina delivers the goods as curious, dynamic and funny woman that anyone would like to have as a friend. Zhang Meng'er on the other side represents a much darker character shaped by dramatic events from the past who is much more difficult to approach with her tough, relentless and independent personality.

The expensive special effects certainly deliver the goods as well. The scenes in a fantasy world, in Ancient China and in contemporary San Francisco are all equally stunning to watch. The fantastic creatures such as dragons look impressive on the big screen.

The story might be predictable but is nevertheless entertaining from start to finish thanks to steady pace and inspired execution. You will truly care about the fates of the different characters as you are watching this film.

However, this film isn't without its occasional flaws. First of all, lead actor Simu Liu simply doesn't have the charisma of the other actresses and actors involved. Casting him was a bold choice but it didn't fully pay off in my opinion.

Up next, the movie desperately tries to connect to other characters in the Marvel Universe. The appearance of Trevor Slattery played by Ben Kingsley is completely random as it only seems to be a pretext to offer some misplaced comic relief. The mid-credit scene starts in an amusing fashion but suddenly involving Bruce Banner and Carol Danvers only seems like a weak attempt to develop a hype for potential sequels. The same goes for yet another scene after the credits that evokes more questions rather than concluding the film appropriately.

At the end of the day, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is an entertaining fantasy action film of the Marvel Universe that should appeal to faithful and occasional fans alike. It's one of the better films in the franchise but perhaps Marvel should focus on quality over quantity instead of becoming a monstrous capitalistic machine that is scarier than any gigantic dragon shown in the film.","Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is yet another movie inspired by the Marvel universe that has constantly been inspiring the cinematic world for more than a decade now.

1162,1162,"A fun time at the movies, and that's all it really needed to be","Charming and incredibly fun- Shang-Chi may not be the best Marvel has had to offer- but it is one of their better films in some time. My main problems with the film lie in the films storyline, which to be honest, is really good, but incredibly all over the place editing wise and there is just so much of it that it feels like two movies could have been made out of it. I love that we get a more in depth look at our characters, their flaws, their regrets, the tragedy in their lives- but the editing makes it feel rather out of place at times- and takes away from the impact the film could have had and its heart. That being said, the film still manages to be very enjoyable throughout. The action scenes are absolutely incredible, the look of the film incredibly well developed- something very fresh and original for Marvel studios- and the cast are all a joy to watch- especially Simu Liu and Aquafina in the lead and supporting roles. I was skeptical of Aquafina being in a Marvel movie for sure, but she really helped the film as a whole, and honestly I would love to see more of her character in future Marvel projects. The film is entertaining, despite the pacing of the film being a bit all over the place at times. It has some brilliant, elaborate special effects that you will be gawking at on the screen, and plenty of surprises that will be bound to make you smile. In the end, Shang-Chi was a fun time for a Marvel movie- something most comic-book flicks have forgotten about recently- and i'm excited what this character has to offer in future films.

1163,1163,Shang-Chi and NOT the Ten Rings -_-,"As someone that really enjoys the MCU, I'm starting to wonder if COVID may have killed it. Black Widow was a meh experience and now Shang-Chi feels like more of that rote, by the numbers repetitiveness. Yes, they add a lot of Asian elements here to bring in other groups and try and lessen the white dominance of this franchise and I appreciate that but this movie felt like it was rushing through the plot to get to the next fantastical element and in so doing really robbed those moments of any lingering significance. Not to mention, the Marvel formula felt so very pronounced. It's so obvious what's going to happen in this movie from the jump and that's disappointing.

That aside, I'm a moderate fan of older Marvel comics and... THESE AREN'T THE TEN RINGS! Normally I don't mind when the MCU makes little adjustments to the source material. Comics are weird and a lot of that stuff wouldn't translate well to film, I get that but so far they've had two big, fat whiffs on anything Mandarin related. Looking at you Iron Man 3. These things are just super generic bands with pretty underwhelming powers which is so different from the 10 rings in the comics that all do something different!

Nerd rage aside, this just felt average to me. I'll probably check it out at some point again but I'm not feeling any sort of draw to revisit it soon. It's a touch more disappointing as I work through the Disney+ Marvel shows which all feel more engaging and more creative than this. Come on, Mouse. Get it together and put some of this TV magic back on the big screen!","As someone that really enjoys the MCU, I'm starting to wonder if COVID may have killed it.

Not to mention, the Marvel formula felt so very pronounced. It's so obvious what's going to happen in this movie from the jump and that's disappointing.

That aside, I'm a moderate fan of older Marvel comics and... THESE AREN'T THE TEN RINGS! Normally I don't mind when the MCU makes little adjustments to the source material. Comics are weird and a lot of that stuff wouldn't translate well to film, I get that but so far they've had two big, fat whiffs on anything Mandarin related. Looking at you Iron Man 3. These things are just super generic bands with pretty underwhelming powers which is so different from the 10 rings in the comics that all do something different!

Nerd rage aside, this just felt average to me. I'll probably check it out at some point again but I'm not feeling any sort of draw to revisit it soon. It's a touch more disappointing as I work through the Disney+ Marvel shows which all feel more engaging and more creative than this. Come on, Mouse. Get it together and put some of this TV magic back on the big screen!"
1164,1164,Incredible MCU origin story,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is an incredible MCU origin story that's epic, emotional and extremely thrilling whilst also connecting to the greater universe in fun and satisfying ways. It's definitely the best thing in phase 4 so far even if it's third act has some of the usual MCU problems.

Simu Liu gives an incredible and extremely charismatic lead performance whilst also having superb chemistry with Awkwafina, who is also incredible. Michelle Yeoh and Meng'er Zhang are both great and Tony Leung is amazing as one of the better villains in the MCU with plenty of backstory and depth.

Destin Daniel Cretton's direction is excellent, it's extremely well filmed and stylish with some of the best action sequences in the franchise. The fight choreography is extremely impressive and the CG is mostly strong. It's well paced and both the soundtrack and the music by Joel P. West are both fantastic.","Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is an incredible MCU origin story that's epic, emotional and extremely thrilling whilst also connecting to the greater universe in fun and satisfying ways.

Great Pacing: Shang Chi has a lot of things built into the tale as it tries to make an origin story fit so far into the movie series. With all the information, there might be worry of the pace being off, but surprisingly it is done super well. Never really dragging, but not moving a blinding pace (mostly), Shang Chi's combination tales keeps things moving but not flying over the important elements to connect with characters. The cast gets ample time to give us their backstories, piece together all the cluse of this dynamic drama puzzle, and not sacrifice on the action to come.

Character Development: The trailers may have you thinking this is a modern martial arts film, and in a sense they would be right. However, the movie takes it one step further and goes beyond the punches to instead give the characters some soul and layers compared to the legendary films of the past. Shang's life is complicated and torn between light and dark, his sister as well experiencing the drama in her own manner that parallels the main protagonist. Even the antagonist has layers far beyond what we normally get from the Marvel group, and I loved how well their lines mixed together to make this melodramatic family story fit naturally into the Marvel universe.

The Surprise Cameo: Can't say much without spoiling, but if you are like me, then you will not be disappointed who shows up in the film. Several questions are answered with this character's return and with it many laughs to be had in the manner very familiar to Marvel fans. The inclusion of this character also holds an important (albeit stretch) plot element to give a little more meaning behind it, and I loved the choices they made to include him in the big picture.

The Cultural Influence: Like Black Panther and the African Culture, Shang Chi integrates so much of the cultural values of the Asian provinces into this movie. The costumes are stunning takes on the traditional attire, bringing the past to light while also sewing in some modern styles to jazz up the outfits. Concepts of family honor, the customs to practicing Marshal Arts, and the honoring of family are well-integrated into the story and help give the predictable tale some extra Kung Fu kick. The architecture of most of the setting breathes new life to the typical cityscapes that have been made famous in Marvel, and the legends of the Ten rings scream of the Asian mythology that is seeped int heir history. I loved how well these things were merged into a Marvel tale, and though again a little predictable and flaunting, really elevated the origin story to stand out from so many others.

The CGI Finally Disney has invested in making their movies show off what the studio can do. Shan Chi and the bunch have plenty of amazing things to overuse the computer effects that the modern era loves. Special effects for the action scenes has more realism to it then Black Widow executed, the creatures you will see have a lot more polish and fluidity to their movements, and the special effects involving the ten rings are fluid and holding depth that I felt has been missing in some recent Marvel projects.

The Acting: A great part played by all members on this film, extras included, Shang Chi's cast shows that acting is not dead and characters can be utilized well. Simu Liu as the lead was fantastic, and his campaign for being in this movie could not have ended up with better results. He holds much of the prodigal martial artist, disciplined and focused to be an avid fighter capable of crushing his enemies with his style. However, he also has that troubled layer in the past to watch that helped spread his emotional spectrum. Awkwafina is still the same cooky role she always plays, but this time gets a little more balance and heroism compared to the other characters she has heralded as in the past. I loved how well she was used in this film, and how great she complemented Simu in this role. Leung brings a lot of pizazz to the character, once again giving us an antagonist with so much more than the scowl and fist, and I felt was a perfect casting to play the opponent of Shang Chi. So many other great actors and actresses in this film, but due to time restrictions I have to move on, but trust me they did well in their performances.

The Comedy: Awkwafina is often used too much for making us laugh, and Disney has struggled with forcing a lot of comedy to make it kid friendly. However, Shang Chi has taken some steps back into discipline and used the comedy well to break up the ice. Dialogue goes a long way to breaking in the laughs, with well-timed jokes and gags being the solid punch to the gut with comedy. There are several ridiculous inclusions in this film that at first seem out of place, but then roll back in to be an extravagant joke that had great set up. And the throw in references that come with it and you get a shining beacon of awesomeness that comes with this movie. It's all done so well and I was very happy with the results.

The Action: My bread and butter for most of the Marvel movies, Shang Chi delivered very well on this film's action exposé. The art of choreographed battles brings another homage to Asian culture, and with it fantastic fights that had more bite and impressive skill use then half of the Marvel cinema. It's exciting, it's dynamic, and most of the fights have a different feel to them than what you might expect. Used well in the story, there is purpose behind the inclusion of the battles and each one has a different meaning and stakes behind it than simply punching and kicking. Even more so, the strategies behind them and what is required to win, accomplishes a level of storytelling that has been lost in the modern era, so well done on that too.

A Bit More Adult: The movie is definitely showing Marvel's modernization into the 21st century, and takes a risk of making this film darker and more adult than other installments. Cursing is definitely increased in this one, with plenty of swear words filling the dialogue, but not to the point of being overdone. No F bombs, but some of the language has got a little more bite, so caution. In addition, the tone of the tale is darker, and the sunshine and rainbows of Thor, Captain America, and Guardians is left in the dust for a grittier tale, which again is a plus.

Some of the political moments: While nowhere as bad as 75% of movies today, Shang Chi does sometimes get a bit preachy with the agenda politics of the film. Taking time out to rub it in our faces with an obvious line stating, ""Look what I had to do,"" was a bit of showboating that I could have done without. Yet even this dislike is marginal, given it's very little occurring, has some nice moments that build off of it, and sometimes has a fun lesson or joke built in.

A Little More Action:

The action in this movie is great, and I loved how much of it flowed and accomplished what I was expecting of the film, and things I was not expecting. Yet there were times where a moment of fighting felt a little forced, namely the chase scenes with vehicles that seemed like an afterthought. However, the fights at the end needed some more time for me, and perhaps a little more bouncing between the battles occurring at the same time. Star Wars has done this successfully in the past, showing all manners of battling and giving you a big scope of the battle. Shang Chi has done this better than several of the Marvel films, but still had some room to give us more looks at the other characters kicking butt. The battle is lengthy enough, I'll agree to that, but a little more showing off of the other warriors would have rounded this fight to perfection for me.

The VERDICT:

Shang Chi finally made me feel like we were back into the realm of Marvel I fell in love with years ago. A cultural building world with both origin and story continuation, this hero's quest had all the makings of a fun, exciting and swift adventure we were expecting. Buried beneath the amazing fights and special effects, was a deeper movie than I had expected, using their characters well and integrating them to serve a purpose. Balanced comedy with a cultural inclusion and politics did not steal away from the main theme of the movie, and giving it that adult touch was a plus in my book, though again caution with your little ones watching it. As for limitations, I agree there is predictability and familiarity with the movie, but the fresh twist and balance helps rejuvenate the formula and add minimize the impact of the limitations for me. Though I will say a little better wider scope battle is still needed by them. Overall, my scores for this film are:

Action/Adventure/Fantasy: 9.0-9.5 Movie Overall: 8.5-9.0.","Likes

1168,1168,Most Mystical and Beautiful Movie In History!,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is the most mystical and beautiful movie in history! The music, the special effects and the acting all take you to another world. The film leaves you wanting a Morris of your own.

The storyline follows a young man named Shang-Chi (Simu Liu). His father is a one thousand-year-old man and conqueror nicknamed The Mandarin (Tony Leung Chiu-wai), who has only ever used the infamous and all-powerful Ten Rings for evil. When the Mandarin is set to unleash infinite evil on the universe, Shang-Chi has to stop his father.

This movie is a cinematic experience. The fighting and choreography are out of this world. The long slow motion shots make the audience feel as if they are in a video game. Simu steals the show; every fight scene is flawless with his fluid movements and it proves just how hard he worked on his character for this film. Every audience falls in love with Shang-Chi; he's funny, with perfect comedic timing and he knows the balance between peace and violence. He encapsulates what the majority of young adults feel - like not being able to find their place in the world. The movie makes fans feel as if they've known Shang for years. It has wonderful flashbacks, which give the audience glimpses of his past, his pain and how his fears have shaped who he is. The film gives a wonderful all-around scope of this character that feels like a friend we've known all our life. It makes fans excited to see Shang-Chi again. Shang and his sister Xu Xialing are an iconic duo. They're both powerful and, while there's some tension due to their past, they put everything aside and let love shine through. Xialing is a role model, officially joining the Marvel Cinematic Universe's most powerful women. Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is perfect for AAPI (Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders) representation in cinema. It represents Chinese culture powerfully, shows what it's like to be an Asian-American in modern day USA, not to mention that Simu is Marvel Studios' first Asian-American superhero. Simu and Shang-Chi are writing history while also inspiring children and fans all around the world. The film delivers on all grounds; the cameos are shocking and leave you on the edge of your seat. Trying not to shout during the two post credits scenes prove to be a challenge. By the end of the movie, I wanted to sing the song ""Hotel California"" at the top of my lungs.

This film reminds you to search for who you are and let your past guide you to who you want to be. Ever since his mother died, Shang has been trained by his father to use violence. When he arrives at his mother's village, he learns how to find peace within himself and the world around him. He learns to trust himself and to use the rings for good.

I give Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 10 to 18 plus adults. It is available only in theaters September 3, 2021.

1171,1171,"More movies like this, please, Marvel","Thought I was feeling some Marvel fatigue after WandaVision (which started strong but ended on a bit of a whimper) and Black Widow (which wasn't terrible, but two months later I can't remember anything about it except how Florence Pugh was cool in it), but this one has rejuvenated some of my enthusiasm for the unstoppably huge MCU.

There's a satisfying origin story here, with a few small appearances from familiar characters that add spice to a host of new characters who are all quite compelling right out of the gate.

The action's great, and there's also so much of it- I liked how lots of the action felt relatively grounded by MCU standards, with neat stunt work and exciting camerawork making the action pop (it's only the final battle that gets really CGI heavy).

The humour's also more consistent than most Marvel films, with most of the jokes landing. Also cool were all the fantasy elements and creatures- they were all pretty inventive and well-executed.

I will say the one notable flaw is that there's a lot of exposition in the film's second half, but they get around that a little by having great actors like Tony Leung and Michelle Yeoh do most of the explaining (and there is a lot to explain, with this being a whole new side of the MCU and all), so it's not super noticeable.","Thought I was feeling some Marvel fatigue after WandaVision (which started strong but ended on a bit of a whimper) and Black Widow (which wasn't terrible, but two months later I can't remember anything about it except how Florence Pugh was cool in it), but this one has rejuvenated some of my enthusiasm for the unstoppably huge MCU.

1174,1174,A family story,"Shang chi is a great movie with some very well made action scenes. It have some funny moments and serious ones. The whole story is about family, friendship. Its a classic line story but still pretty interesting to follow (costume design, environnment, revenge story) and the visual effects as always with marvel is pretty great to watch. I recommend it.","Shang chi is a great movie with some very well made action scenes. It have some funny moments and serious ones. The whole story is about family, friendship.

1175,1175,"Could be better, still enjoyable","As a MCU fanatic, I've been trying to get excited about the movies they have released post-Endgame, but it has been a challenge. That particular film was such a perfect finale for the series that I have struggled with the efforts to get the storyline going again. It doesn't help that they have been so scattered in topics, lacking a single core group to bring them all together. Shang-Chi is another random hero that I only knew vaguely from references in the comics, but I never read any of his books back when I was a collector. I appreciated that this film brought a new style to a MCU movie. The blending of Wuxia into a superhero story was a fun choice.

There were also quite a few great actors in this film including Tony Leung, Ben Kingsley, Michelle Yeoh, and I'd even include Awkwafina in that category. I can certainly see how some other people might struggle with Awkwafina's schtick, but I find her comedic timing to be great, and I was laughing along the whole time. However, the one major name I left out of the ""great actors"" is Simu Liu. Sadly, I found him a little bland. He was okay with the comedy, but I certainly don't see him stacking up with the legends that have come before in the MCU. Heck, Benedict Wong has only about 5 minutes of screentime in this film, but still made a greater impression on me than Simu Liu.

Digging into the story of Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, I'd say it's a fine origin story, even if it was highly predictable. This is the kind of movie where you can stay 10 steps ahead of it, and that is unfortunate. I think that's the biggest problem with the entire film, while it's fun and engaging it also feels like a rough carbon copy of things that came before. It's a movie that is emulating a number of Wuxia films from the past, but it's not as good as any of them. It's a movie that is following the tropes of a superhero origin story, and once again isn't on the level of the best of the genre. You can't fault their ambition, but their execution was lacking.

All that negativity is not to say that Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is a bad film. In fact, I enjoyed the entire time in the theater, and was genuinely invested in the story. I thought it handled the links to the MCU well, but without feeling like it had shameless pandering for the fans, or devolving into obscure references only people like myself would understand. The film had some gorgeous visuals, and created its own world in a way that managed to be both unique but still consistent with the style of other MCU movies. There were personal stakes in the film, despite the fact that the ending fell into a giant CGI battle that felt unnecessary. I can't say that Shang-Chi will rise into the upper echelon of my MCU rankings, but it's better than some that came before.","As a MCU fanatic, I've been trying to get excited about the movies they have released post-Endgame, but it has been a challenge.

Sean (Shang-Chi) lives in San Francisco and parks cars for a living with his best friend Katy, whom he met when they were 14. He's happy with his life. He enjoys karaoke.

One day these bad, scary looking guys attack Sean and Katy on a bus and demand the green pendant Sean wears around his neck,,,

Oh yeah,,, Sean's real name is Shang-Chi, and his father is the leader of the TEN RINGS terrorist organization. What?!?!?!?!?!?

The visuals are incredible, and Awkwafina is hilarious!

1177,1177,Marvel's answer to Shonen Jump.,"Shang Chi is Marvel's latest blockbuster to grace the movies: and after 2020's non-existent Marvel slate, it was about bloody time we got something after the world dealt with the sars-variant and got our double shots. And now, late 2021 we can finally go back to the movies en masse, though the road to recovery's far from over.

Shang Chi is part-origin-story for a character we've never known before, part-CG-spectacle interlaced with nice kung-fu choreography in between, all in-universe expansion for Marvel's cinematic ambitions. And it makes you wonder how deeply they thought about paying reverence to everything from Bruce Lee to the Matrix, to Dragon Ball, The Last Airbender and Kung Fu Panda.

Marvel is doing its best to escape the confines of Iron Man's legacy, and this seems like an earnest start for something far-removed from the likes of Spider-Man, and so on. Also makes you wonder if Awkwafina is gonna become a major player outside the Shang Chi movies alone.

Shang Chi is the stuff you've come to expect from Marvel Studios; it's going big and it won't stop with every subsequent film here onward. Though bigger and better seems better fitted for high-concept space operas like Infinity War and Endgame than more earthbound character-driven stories.

Shang Chi's good fun, and it really succeeds in being that during its runtime.","Shang Chi is Marvel's latest blockbuster to grace the movies: and after 2020's non-existent Marvel slate, it was about bloody time we got something after the world dealt with the sars-variant and got our double shots.

1178,1178,Shang Chi,"Review By Kamal K

Marvels new Shang-Chi was a choreographed dance movie disguised as Kung fu with slow paced action scenes and subtle but detailed components that pull a story together a satisfying but inappropriately fast paced manner. Making the writing seem more lazy and poorly thought out, which for me took away greatly from that satisfaction.

The main gripe I have with Shang Chi is how it just so happens that the Jade neckaces show the path and time to the hidden forest path just days before another oath opens for them to go find the tao lao.

Although the comedy music, and some of the choreography for the fight scenes were good enough to give this movie a final score of 6 out of 10 score.","Review By Kamal K

1179,1179,Entertaining but still not 'old' MCU level,"I have to admit I've been pretty disappointed with every MCU movie since Endgame so I was pleasantly surprised by Shang-Chi, which I didn't really have high hopes for (the last Marvel martial arts based hero was Iron Fist, and that was a turd). This movie was very entertaining even if it had a pretty generic and predictable storyline, and special effects were fairly uneven (amazing 'MCU quality' along with pretty terrible early 2000s CGI). It's great to add more diversity with an Asian superhero but I hope they will make good use of him in future movies and not relegate him to secondary sidekick roles!","I have to admit I've been pretty disappointed with every MCU movie since Endgame so I was pleasantly surprised by Shang-Chi, which I didn't really have high hopes for (the last Marvel martial arts based hero was Iron Fist, and that was a turd).

Also, we have Awkwafina destroying every type of scene (dramatic; epic; and also the comedic ones) with one of the worst ""acting"" I've ever seen and a same type of joke (""awkward nonsense"") over and over, from start to finish, with a role ridiculously large for a dumb comic relief.

1183,1183,A standalone ret-con of previous MCU mistakes.,"With the end of the Infinity Saga in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, there is a lot of room for new franchises to fill in the gaps left by the likes of Iron Man and Captain America. However, this means lesser-known properties like Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (2021) get their chance to shine. And while lesser-known franchises like Guardians of the Galaxy are now household names, I think it remains to be seen if Shang-Chi can truly develop its own integrated identity within the MCU.

Having somewhat botched the introduction of the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) in Iron Man 3 (2013), Shang-Chi attempts to ret-con this by insisting that the Ten Rings organization is a genuine threat to world peace. However, Marvel wants to have its cake and eat it too by including the ""Mandarin"" in this film. There are a few other loose connections to the larger MCU in this film, but they are more cameo call-outs than anything significant. Overall, Shang-Chi is its own story.

The fact that a good portion of this film's climax takes place in a mythical hidden kingdom made it feel disconnected from the MCU as a whole. Sure, other franchises within the MCU have their origin stories. Still, I felt they made it clear how they contributed to the ""whole"" of the larger arc by either introducing characters or concepts in prior MCU movies. Shang-Chi excels in its action and choreography but feels generic in the grand scheme of things as a standalone film. I'd almost wager that its sequel will be much more interesting and that those not already committed to the MCU can probably give this one a pass.

A standalone ret-con of previous MCU mistakes, I give Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings 3.0 stars out of 5.","With the end of the Infinity Saga in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, there is a lot of room for new franchises to fill in the gaps left by the likes of Iron Man and Captain America.

1184,1184,See Shang-Chi on the Big Screen,"The new Marvel Super Hero film, SHANG-CHI and the LEGEND OF THE TEN RINGS is the kind of film that deserves to be seen on the big screen and Writer/Director Destin Daniel Cretton (JUST MERCY) has crafted a film that earns that statement.

Based on the Marvel comic book character (of course), SHANG-CHI tells the tale of...well...Shang-Chi a financially struggling - but happy - Valet in San Francisco who has a family secret.

Writer/Director Cretton has crafted a whimsical, mythological, mystical and action packed film that settles in at the top end of the Marvel Cinematic Universe family of films.

At the center, newcomer Simu Liu (KIM'S CONVENIENCE) more than holds his own as the newest Super Hero in the MCU. He is grounded, centered and more sure than unsure as he discovers his abilities and his family's secrets. He is a worthy addition to this world of Superheroes.

Joining him is the remarkable Awkwafina (CRAZY, RICH ASIANS) as his best friend, sidekick who handles the drama comedy and action with aplomb. This film makes some smart choices with this character and Awkwafina shines.

The rest of the cast/characters are equally as strong from Tony Chi-Wai Leung (as Shang-Chi's father) to Meng'er Zhang (as Shang-Chi's sister) and good ol' Michelle Yeoh (as Shang-Chi's Aunt) bring strong characters to life. They all shine.

This film also brings back a character from a previous MCU film that somewhat redeems the poorly conceived character from his earlier appearance. I won't spoil it by saying who it is, but I liked what the MCU did with this character.

But, this being a Marvel movie, all of these performances anchor a bigger picture that is filled with action, action and more action - and something else, something mystical.

Here is where Director Cretton really shines. The action scenes are interestingly staged and choreographed well. The first fight (the bus fight that is shown in the trailer) and a fight on scaffolding both particularly work well.

This film does delve into the mystical in the last 1/3 and in Cretton's hands, this ends up working well instead of being comical or inane. I bought what was going on and was rooting for our heroes to defeat the undefeatable, fantastical creatures.

To be honest, the ""final battle"" didn't really live up to the rest of the film so that brings this film down a notch, but this movie did what it needed it to do, it opened up a whole new area of the Marvel Cinematic Universe - in both character and locations - and I am anxious to see where they go from here.

Try to see SHANG-CHI on the Big Screen, the visuals are worth it.

1192,1192,Ten Rings to rule them all...,"Positives:
This is Marvel at its best. A script (with Shakespearean undertones) that melds action with good character development and laugh-out-loud feelgood dialogue. The great thing is that you don't need to be a Marvel nerd to enjoy this one. Yes, there are some fabulous Easter Eggs for Marvel fans (and a wonderful return of a character from one of the early films). But its almost a standalone feature in its own right.


The action sequences are top-notch, particularly an early fight on a careering an Francisco ""bendy-bus"". Some great martial arts reminiscent of ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", made more exciting by the fact that the impressive Simu Liu did all his own stunts.






Negatives:






Timeline?: So, it took more of a Marvel nerd than I am (my wonderful daughter-in-law Bronwyn) to point out that although this film is set (largely) in the ""Present Day"", the events of ""Avengers: Endgame"" actually happen in 2023. So in the Marvel timeline, this is set in between Thanos's ""blip"" and ""the return"". This is the reason why Wong is present but not Doctor Strange, for example.

Summary Thoughts: Marvel goes East! This is a really entertaining addition to the franchise, mixing Marvel action with Eastern mysticism and martial arts. It's an impressive job by director and co-writer Destin Daniel Cretton, in only his second feature (he did ""Just Mercy"" in 2019).

As a Marvel film, there are of course end-credit scenes (""monkeys"" in onemannsmovies speak). A mid-title one is the best, bringing some additional Marvel characters into the mix. And there's a post-credits one which sets up for further sequels but which I found rather irritating.

It's ironic that a Marvel movie so right for the Chinese market - the first to be headlined by an Asian actor and with substantial Mandarin dialogue - might not get a release in China. According to this report, this appears to be for two reasons: firstly that the actor Simu Liu made some derogatory remarks about China in the past, and secondly that in the comics Shang Chi's father is Fu Manchu - a Western-derived character with racial overtones.

This doesn't seem to have hurt it so far. After less than two weeks of opening, it has made $262 million on a budget estimated to be $150-200 million.

1196,1196,One of the most Emotionally Charged Superhero Movies made in recent times.,"Let's keep aside all these serious conversations about Asian Representation, Diversity and all other societal stuff for a moment and let us all just appreciate Marvel for creating one of the most (if not the Most) emotionally charged superhero movies in recent times.

I'm not even exaggerating, I have been a follower of Marvel since my teenage days, suffice it to say, Through many ups and downs I keenly witnessed all of their works over the years. Trust me when I say that they have very much revamped their strategy this time around.

Excluding their typical set-up for a Comicbook blockbuster, Shang-Chi's familial/dramatic aspects are on an all-time high here. The way this story has been told, it just feels somewhat distinctive and special (Especially, compared to the last few projects Marvel has had come up with).

Other than the apparent masteries in its Audio-Visual departments (as expected); the narrative here infuses a powerful statement, a different outlook on family & self-acceptance. And guess what? It never sounded preachy nor pretentious; not for a single moment.

Another praiseworthy characteristic is the Action sequences or to be precise, all the Choreography behind! An incredible show for the Martial Arts fans and yeah FYI Simu Liu (Shang-Chi); our primary protagonist did most of his stunts, all by himself; that is amazing Isn't it?

Pretty much the same impression applies to all the other members of the ensemble; however, I do have some serious reservations about their respective character depictions.

To start with, Shang-Chi's estranged father (Played by a veteran, Tony Leung Chiu-wai); The writing on his character felt a bit detached and incoherent! Don't know about you, but for the most part, I was rather uncertain about what should I exactly feel about this guy! Should I be sympathetic or furious about the choices he had made? Gotta say this dilemma got the better of me.

Furthermore, the Mother of Shang-Chi (Played by Fala Chen) from Ta-Lo; I do feel her screentime in here should have been elongated a little bit more! Just so the viewers could grasp her part of the storyline too! Other than that, she, herself was pretty great in there. No complaints whatsoever. And Oh yeah, Nora Lum or Awkwafina (The Name, majority of you might know her by). She was terrific in her role as well; the much-needed comic relief in such a sob story!

In a nutshell, I must admit, this was a rather unprecedented gamble from Marvel and It did pay off quite well in the end. To be honest, I couldn't be more pleased about that! As I see it, these Superhero films tend to get repetitious over the years so it's always like a breath of fresh air whenever there is a drastic transition coming straight from the creators, and when it gets backed up by the Big Studios themselves; well that's your cherry on top.","Let's keep aside all these serious conversations about Asian Representation, Diversity and all other societal stuff for a moment and let us all just appreciate Marvel for creating one of the most (if not the Most) emotionally charged superhero movies in recent times.

1197,1197,What a pleasant surprise this was!,"Visually a perfect film for me watching a film in theatre after 20 months. Going in I expected marvel to half-ass the genre but still make it entertaining like a number of their other films. But I was taken aback wonderfully right from the beginning with the opening narration completely in Chinese. What I saw then was a proper modern wuxia fantasy which with some changes could've fooled me for a Chinese production (maybe I'm being a bit hyperbolic).

As fitting to a wuxia film, the lust for power, the love that conquers evil and the despair of lost love are all seen in this film. And who best to bring all those than the legendary Tony Leung who was the face of Hong Kong cinema through In The Mood For Love and acted in some of the best Wuxia films. He was definitely the best thing about the film. I was half expecting Marvel to mess it up like they use great actors for villains all the time. But he was the first main character to appear and even till the end his presence was felt.

This also has some of the best hand to hand action sequences in the MCU easily. The martial arts action, even when the superpowers are included also makes the action just beautiful which is something I feel the first time in an MCU film.

Awkwafina was quirky but what I liked there was that they kept it platonic and didn't jump into anything at any point. Maybe they'd do that in the future but at least they didn't break the flow in the relationship. Meng'er Zhang and Fala Chen also made their presence felt, as badass fighters. And Michelle Yeoh as expected of her came in and owned the screen when she was present.

I'm really surprised at how much I liked the film. The final fight sequences that rose to the most epic Chinese fantasy fight you can think of is the only thing I was expecting them to not mess up. Maybe it is because of my low expectations on how Marvel deals with the genre and the villain that made me love this so much.","Visually a perfect film for me watching a film in theatre after 20 months.

1198,1198,A Very Fresh MCU Entry,"When Iron Man hit theatres back in 2008, there were rumblings about a cinematic universe starting, but obviously, nobody expected that we would make it to a film like Avengers: Endgame at the time. Along the way, unknown properties like Guardians of the Galaxy and Ant-Man came out of nowhere as well but were welcomed with open arms. I was really hoping that Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings would follow in those footsteps, and it more than does. With rich world-building, a great cast, and the use of mythology, this is one of my favourite Marvel Cinematic Universe entries to date. Over time I may even come to appreciate it even more. After a first viewing, here's why Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings deserves to be seen on the big screen (if you can).

After being trained as an assassin by his father, Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) is given ten years of freedom from this life. In the present, the film picks up with Shang-Chi (Shaun) as he is living a normal life in San Francisco with his friend Katy (Awkwafina). When the history/mythology of the so-called Ten Rings is brought back into the forefront, his mission is to go and find his father. With the help of his friend and sister, they return home to face the music and it may just end up being father vs son to save this world. From start to finish, this film delves into the fun, the mythological, the family drama, and some incredible martial arts in order to tell this very solid story.

Aside from the fact that newcomer Simu Liu is undeniably charming and very likeable in this role, it's the unique style of the movie that made it stand out from the rest of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Yes, it still has the same look and feel, especially when it comes to aesthetics and comedic relief, but the rest of the film had its own distinct heartbeat. Bringing martial arts into this franchise just felt like a breath of fresh air to me. Not only does it feel simultaneous that they're trying to have fun and pay homage to classic films of this nature, but the fact that martial arts, mixed with actual god-like powers just felt so earned by the climax of the film. Without giving anything away, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is far more magical and mystical than I was expecting, but I kind of loved the finale when looking back on it.

There's really not much about this film that I feel compelled to complain about, but I will say that with as much drama that this film has and with how much it does dive into mythology, sometimes the comedy felt out of place. Awkwafina as Katy was great and I think her chemistry with Simu Liu was great as well, but I think certain cuts to her one-liners felt a little unnecessary for the specific situation. There are a few scenes where moments deserve our full attention, but the film felt the need to cut away to something funnier. Aside from the humour taking me out a few times, this film is just a blast.

Overall, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Tens Rings is easily at the top of the origin films that this franchise has given us and probably one of my favourite entries as a whole. Director Destin Daniel Cretton (Short Term 12, Just Mercy) has done a great job here and the cinematography by Bill Pope (The Matrix, Baby Driver) was also a real standout. I thought the scope of the movie felt very grand and that's absolutely in part to how it was filmed. I almost thought the finale of the movie was going to be a huge negative, but again, after thinking about the movie again, there is a nice progression in the story that makes the climax feel earned, even if a tad overblown. If you're a fan of this franchise, this one is a must-see, but even if you're not, this one can stand on its own as well, having only a few acknowledgements to previous films.

Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is now playing exclusively in theatres and if you're able to go in your area, I highly recommend it.","When Iron Man hit theatres back in 2008, there were rumblings about a cinematic universe starting, but obviously, nobody expected that we would make it to a film like Avengers: Endgame at the time.

1199,1199,Good,"One of the best origin MCU films. Good story, great and complex family relationships, with it's own identity, a very good balance between action and comedy and really good fight scenes. Between Simu Liu, Awkwafina and Tony Leung it's difficult to decide which was the best, but the acting was really strong all around (also a mention to Ben Kingsley, always funny!). The best thing I can say about it is that for most of it's duration it didn't even feel like an MCU film.

The negatives? Again, too much CGI. It's a huge problem with Marvel and Disney as they use the green screen in almost every scene. I like CGI but seriously, some scenes would look much better with practical effects, others would look way better if they just were shot at location.","One of the best origin MCU films.

1204,1204,A miss in the MCU.,"Hollywood trying to be too woke about being Chinese.

Always hate it when they make a villain not really a villain as to not offend anyone. Shang Chi's father is supposed to be a pure villain, the mother storyline took away a lot from the real storyline.

Awkwafina's character becoming a boss archer after one day of training was equally ridiculous.

Hopefully if a sequel is made it will be darker, though I'll admit the Mandarin was a funny touch.","Hollywood trying to be too woke about being Chinese.

1205,1205,A Great Origin Film,"The next instalment of the MCU, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings has come out and I managed to see it the other day and I have finally found time to review it and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees a young martial artist forced to face his past when his criminal father comes hunting for him.

Main Character Relative unknown Simu Liu plays Shang-Chi and he is really good in this role. He really delivers a strong performance and you will come out of the film really liking him and caring about the character of Shang-Chi. The focus on his family dynamic is really well done and Liu does a great job in selling that and showing the pain that he has been through in his life and bringing this great hero to life. He is also fantastic in the action scenes and that is a huge part of this film and you have to believe in the heroes capabilities and I really did.

Supporting Characters Awkwafina plays his best friend Katy and I feel like this character is really going to split opinion, some will hate her, some will love her. I pretty much hit both ends of the spectrum, I thought she was really annoying in the first act of the film and it hurt my enjoyment, but as she had her role slightly lessened she became much more likeable and her character arc became very clear. Tony Leung plays his first role in an American film playing Wenwu and this is one of the best antagonists in the current MCU. I loved this character and performance, he isn't just some generic bad guy and at times I really understood his motivations and saw the emotion from his performance and it was really strong. Meng'er Zhang plays Xialing and I liked her character here and I thought it really complemented Shang-Chi really well. There is clearly issues there and the film plays it up well, and makes her more then just this female sidekick and she is given a personality.

Story The story is at its strongest when it focuses on the family issues between the characters, in particular Shang-Chi and Wenwu. That father and son dynamic is great and both actors deliver really well in their roles and it makes there clashes feel even more important as you genuinely care about both of them in the film. The issue is that the film kind of strays away from that and tries to focus on too much. It has plenty of exposition scenes and fits so much in that it distracts from the main thing that makes this film great. The final act puts the focus in the wrong place, its hard to explain without spoilers but I think you will know what I mean if you watch the film.

Script The script is okay, the drama is really well done and made me care about these characters and the emotional predicaments that they are put in during this adventure and I actually think this film is held back a little bit by the fact that it is in the MCU. What I mean by that is that it has the humour you come to expect from the universe is here but it is done poorly and I never really laughed at all and that was a disappointment.

Style The film looks fantastic, the CGI is all beautiful and I think it does an excellent job of building this world of Martial arts that is very different to other elements of the MCU. The fight scenes live up to the hype and are the best that have been seen in The Marvel Cinematic Universe, the flow so well and are so hard hitting that it is easily the best element of the film.

Overall Overall, Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings is a great film and another solid addition to The Marvel Cinematic Universe. It isn't top tier Marvel but does a great job of introducing a new hero in Shang-Chi.

Rating - 8/10.","The next instalment of the MCU, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings has come out and I managed to see it the other day and I have finally found time to review it and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees a young martial artist forced to face his past when his criminal father comes hunting for him.

Main Character Relative unknown Simu Liu plays Shang-Chi and he is really good in this role. He really delivers a strong performance and you will come out of the film really liking him and caring about the character of Shang-Chi.

1206,1206,A wonderful addition to the MCU!,"Shang-Chi is one of those Marvel films that feels like the full package. It has lots of brilliant trademark MCU humour and tongue in cheek quips. It has exceptional action which I'll get into a bit more. It also has solid connections to the rest of the MCU, balanced well between being its own stand alone film but laying hints of how this is going to fit into the wider story of Phase 4.

I'll start with the action as this is what Shang-Chi is famed for. Quite simply it's awesome. It has the best hand to hand combat the MCU has seen, and sequences that are steeped in Chinese culture, with the rhythmic style of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon woven into the fabric of this film.

The cast was brilliant. Simu Liu was a fantastic lead, and I'd be happy to see him grow into a big player in the MCU. Awkwafina as expected was fantastic, adding so much effortless humour to the film.

What I really love about Shang-Chi is that it has a very well explored and interesting antagonist. This can't always be said for Marvel films as there have been a few phoned in villains, but Shang-Chi doesn't come close to falling into this trap. Tony Leung really sold his role and gave it a lot of power and emotion.

In terms of plot they did a fantastic job of introducing us to this pretty obscure character. There is a lot of exposition and plenty of flashbacks, perhaps too many but I appreciate they had a lot of background content to feed us so I can't grumble too much. I loved how the plot was so mystical and magical, very much feeling like an epic adventure.

Yet again Marvel Studios knocking it out of the park!","Shang-Chi is one of those Marvel films that feels like the full package.

1207,1207,nothing out of this world but a lot better then i expected,,
1208,1208,Showcases the possibilities of Phase 4,"This was the right direction for Marvel to head post-Endgame. Finding new stories to tell within cultures rarely explored is the way for the MCU to continue to entertain.

The fights in the first third of this movie were absolutely brutal and quite innovative. I wish they hadn't front-loaded all of this stunning choreography since the fights later on paled in comparison. This film also contains arguably the most beautiful and artful scene in the MCU with the Crouching Tiger-inspired hidden garden duel. There was a sense of more indie-based filmmaking and I really enjoyed that fresh take on the genre. I would be remiss not to mention Tony Leung, who perfectly brings to life one of the finest villains in the MCU. His character has a lot of depth and is one you can truly empathize with.

While there are still the tropes expected in a Marvel origin film, it succeeds pretty well for the most part. I wish the big CGI battle at the end had just been a personal fight between father and son, but alas. The humor, especially Awkwafina, was pretty hit or miss as well. The Trevor Slattery stuff was great though.

Shang-Chi is definitely one of the best origin films in the MCU and really stands out as a unique entry in the long-running series.","This was the right direction for Marvel to head post-Endgame.

1209,1209,Really good blend of martial arts and MCU formula,"The bus fight scene is one of the best action scenes of the entire MCU. Just for that scene alone, this movie deserves to be watched on the biggest screen possible. Shang Chi benefited from being a very unknown character and the movie gives him the opportunity to shine bright with his development. The story is really fast paced and even if the final act succumbs to the typical Marvel esque, it leaves you with a pretty solid good feeling while leaving the cinema. A really great MCU movie, a superb martial arts spectacle and a great step up for the Phase 4. Do not miss the two post credits scenes. The middle scene is exciting and the very last one is pretty intriguing. Bring it on, Marvel!","The bus fight scene is one of the best action scenes of the entire MCU.

1210,1210,The birth of a new legend,"The birth of a new Marvel Hero. And a very successful one. One of the better Marvel adaptations of the recent years and the perfect introduction of this new hero.

Its packed with amazing action, a great legacy and a wisely picked cast who get the chance to portray fun characters.

To start with Simu Liu who shoots himself to stardom with this film. His portrayal was fun as he perfectly mixes the hero attitude with a nice tongue-in-cheek humor and perfectly develops himself without taking all of it too seriously. Same goes to his co-star Awkwafina who was perfectly cast. Having Tony Leung as the to center-part was an excellent creative decision. Then the film has some fan favorites appearing as Ben Kingsley's Trevor or Benedict Wong who round it up to a wonderful Marvel adventure, just as you would expect.

The action scenes are tremendous, as the film is filled with great Martial Arts sequences, (of course Michelle Yeoh is not to be missed here). The bus scene at the beginning is a true stand out action scene in the entire Marvel universe.

Really a good one for the next phase of Marvel, and I like how it links to the whole universe just perfectly. Another Marvel winner.","The birth of a new Marvel Hero. And a very successful one. One of the better Marvel adaptations of the recent years and the perfect introduction of this new hero.

1211,1211,Elevates itself above the typical superhero origin story by incorporating many fantastic elements from Asian culture,"""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" is the second film in Phase Four of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Starring Simu Liu, Tony Leung, and Awkwafina, it elevates itself above the typical superhero origin story by incorporating many fantastic elements from Asian culture.

In San Francisco, Shaun (Simu Liu) works as a parking valet along with his close friend Katy (Awkwafina). Unbeknownst to Katy, Shaun is hiding important secrets from her - he is in fact a skilled martial artist whose real name is Shang-Chi and he has run away from his father Xu Wenwu (Tony Leung), the leader of the powerful Ten Rings organisation. After some Ten Rings members attack the pair of them on a bus, Shang-Chi discovers that they have stolen a valuable pendant given to him by his mother Li (Fala Chen) before he left for the United States. Shang-Chi grows concerned that the Ten Rings' next target will be the pendant belonging to his younger sister Xialing (Meng'er Zhang), and so along with Katy he sets off to look for her before the gang can locate her first.

Now that the Infinity Saga has concluded, the time has come for some new heroes to enter the MCU. Of course, there are so many to choose from, considering the large roster of characters that have come into existence over the last several decades. Although Shang-Chi wasn't the first one to come to my mind when predicting who would lead the charge of fresh faces into Phase Four, his debut big screen outing ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" successfully cements him as a memorable hero just as worthy as any other past Avenger.

What I believe separates this film from the typical hero origin story is all of the interesting aspects of Asian culture it integrates into the story. I'm all for inclusivity in movies, so long as it isn't shoehorned in there for the sake of appeasing a political agenda, and here it succeeds greatly thanks to the wide array of Asian crew members who worked hard to ensure that virtually all customs are represented. The film never precisely establishes the place Shang-Chi's family is from (though it is hinted to be somewhere in mainland China), as they are seen observing various cultural traditions that don't quite narrow things down to one particular Asian country. For example, there are martial artists resembling Shaolin monks, who are supposed to be from China, seen using techniques from Japanese and Korean folklore. This has likely been done on purpose to ensure that all Asian audiences feel included, but never so much that it comes across as disrespectful. After previously bungling Asian-related matters with the terrible 2020 remake of ""Mulan"", ""Shang-Chi"" feels like an appropriate apology from Disney to all of their viewers.

At this stage, it feels pointless to complain about Marvel films following the exact same template when introducing new heroes so I won't hold that against this one too much. With that said, thanks to some brilliantly choreographed martial arts fight scenes and gorgeous visuals, director Destin Daniel Cretton (""Just Mercy"") has provided us with one of the most unique looking MCU films to date. One scene near the beginning features Xu Wenwu walking through a bright, beautiful oriental garden complete with bamboo reeds in the foreground. A short time later, he is locked in hand-to-hand combat with his future love interest Li. This reminded me of ""wuxia"" films, a popular subgenre of Chinese martial arts movies, like ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"". In fact, this scene was such a good tribute to that genre that I almost forgot this was a Marvel movie and was instead watching one of those classic Kung Fu films my dad used to show me when I was young. You know you've created something special when your film can appeal this effectively to fans of both Marvel and Kung Fu movies.

Considering the last thing I saw him in was the sitcom ""Kim's Convenience"", Simu Liu definitely took me by surprise as to how well cast he was as the film's main star. I was expecting him to be a wisecracking Americanised version of the Asian hero but he actually plays most of the film straight, only responding humorously when absolutely necessary. His dramatic side truly shines when he is interacting with his onscreen father Tony Leung. In fact, Leung's character Xu has one of the most tragic backstories of any character in the whole MCU, which I won't spoil here. Another surprise was Awkwafina as Shang-Chi's best friend Katy. Rather than being another typical love interest, Katy is instead a loyal platonic friend of his who is willing to help him out no matter how limited her knowledge on the field of battle may be. It also helps that she is responsible for most of the film's comic relief.

With a new superhero now officially introduced, it's safe to assume that ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" has shown an optimistic future for the MCU. Its broad appeal to Eastern and Western audiences alike as well as the usual action-packed fun we've come to expect over the years makes it one of the best origin films to come out of the MCU to date. The Marvel hype train shows no signs of slowing down and if things keep going the way they are, it won't be stopping anytime soon.

There's no doubt that the real magic belongs to the epic sequences of fantastical action.

Special effects: average. Characterization: average. Plot twists: average. I still enjoyed myself, and still appreciated Marvel transforming an exploitative property into something culturally rich. But the diminishing returns of Marvel joints continues.","Ben Kingsley won this movie. And it was not particularly close. Probably the stunt coordinator came in a distant second?

1214,1214,"It's very pretty, but the story/plot is mediocre and filled with holes","As far as visuals go, this movie is amazing... like just about as impressive as Dune, it's filled to the brim with eye-candy.

The plot/story however is mediocre and filled with plot holes... the characters' actions are often unrealistic and they will often just 'stare in awe' at their friends being killed, instead of doing the realistic thing, and immediately defending their friends... it's something that happens like 5 times and honestly spoils the movie for me.... if characters in a movie don't act or react realistically and stare at something like a braindead zombie (like their friends getting killed right in front of them, whilst they are holding a gun in their freeking hands), then it's just really terrible script/plot writing.

Overall, the movie isn't as bad as Ant-Man 2 but it's not far behind. Also, Awkwafina's acting style was already old by the 2nd movie she did... ALL of her characters in movies are the same person, and like I said, it got boring after the 2nd movie. I roll my eyes at everything Awkwafina's character does in the movie.

It's a 5/10 movie, not really worth a watch unless you're a real die-hard Marvel fan.","As far as visuals go, this movie is amazing... like just about as impressive as Dune, it's filled to the brim with eye-candy.

1215,1215,There's Dragon Fights!,"What more do you want?

I honestly didn't want to like this film. As you may have read in previous reviews of the Marvel films, they are all dumb. And this one ends as they all do, with just massive CGI chaos. But did I mention they were dragons fighting?

Anyway, the film is fun. Fun and lively in the sense of watching a water painting come to life. The fight sequences are laborious...sometimes. Since being rocked with energy source that could topple buildings doesn't even crack a rib seems silly.

But Shang-Chi makes it work. Here played by the moon-faced wide-eyed and fun loving Simu Liu. And he does a wonderful job NOT wanting to be anything but a typical slacker. While he carries the burden of a darker past..haunted, even...he does his best to make the best of his situation with his San Fran pal Katy. Now usually Awkwafina irritates me to no end. Here, she is much more subdued and is truly a ""bro"" any guy would want in a sisterly form/love interest. The balance of her hip banter to seriousness is flawless. And quite the joy when not on screen.

Big kudos to Tony Leung. Who has spent generations emoting with the most efficient use of words. He doesn't require much and carries a lot. He plays a former evil doer whose only motivation is love.

His fatherly love for his children is only surpassed by regaining a love he's lost. And truly embodies that person who cannot let it go. But that credit goes to Li, played by Fala Chen. A gentle soul in what can be described as Shangri-La. I could watch her do kata for hours. Her gracefulness would make any man want to open the gates of Hell for.

Much praise goes to director Destin Cretton for balancing spirituality with family ties. This is a very difficult line to tow while trying not to be overbearing. He was smart enough to know that the family dynamics of an Asian household have small passive-aggressive moments that pick at the main characters. But doesn't ever go past the ""you must have honor"" trope that infects a movie like ""Mulan""","What more do you want?

While he carries the burden of a darker past..haunted, even...he does his best to make the best of his situation with his San Fran pal Katy. Now usually Awkwafina irritates me to no end. Here, she is much more subdued and is truly a ""bro"" any guy would want in a sisterly form/love interest. The balance of her hip banter to seriousness is flawless. And quite the joy when not on screen.

Big kudos to Tony Leung. Who has spent generations emoting with the most efficient use of words. He doesn't require much and carries a lot. He plays a former evil doer whose only motivation is love.

His fatherly love for his children is only surpassed by regaining a love he's lost. And truly embodies that person who cannot let it go. But that credit goes to Li, played by Fala Chen. A gentle soul in what can be described as Shangri-La. I could watch her do kata for hours. Her gracefulness would make any man want to open the gates of Hell for.

Much praise goes to director Destin Cretton for balancing spirituality with family ties. This is a very difficult line to tow while trying not to be overbearing. He was smart enough to know that the family dynamics of an Asian household have small passive-aggressive moments that pick at the main characters. But doesn't ever go past the ""you must have honor"" trope that infects a movie like ""Mulan"""
1216,1216,Cool one,"Cool worlds/ten-rings VFX, OKayish plot, good characterisations.

But somehow somewhere it felt like the film was actually made for kids maybe because of the story being wholly dependent on the magical dragon.

Also, there could've been some heavy emotions & more action sequences & some twists/turns in the script to have more grip on the audience. Overall, it was a good watch but could've been still better.","Cool worlds/ten-rings VFX, OKayish plot, good characterisations.

1217,1217,An Asian Marvel Origin story with all the spectacle you've come to expect.,"Another great and entertaining experience which is very similar to what has gone before in format, but the formula works very well and I enjoyed the film a lot. The Asian style and presentation is beautiful, showing off plenty of folklore and style in both modern and traditional settings. The presentation is very stylish, the special effects were superb and the martial arts fight scenes were fast and exciting The plot is good, focusing on the human and family side of the characters rather than the magical, and sets up a good intrigue for the continuation of the MCU. The acting is good and although the comic relief and cute character did change things up, they also spoiled it a bit and made the slow middle section drag on even more. The ending was pretty grand and epic, but I felt it could have been better.","Another great and entertaining experience which is very similar to what has gone before in format, but the formula works very well and I enjoyed the film a lot.

1218,1218,Shades of Bruce Lee...,,
1219,1219,Unique. But a very fun film,"I have to say I was looking forward to this one. First film in a while that had no connection to avengers etc so I was intrigued to see how they would do this. And on the whole it was very enjoyable and fun to watch!

First instincts when watching were a little mixed. It was an odd start to say the least and didn't have any idea how this was going to go. And my first instincts on Katy were also mixed. I felt like they were trying to force the humour out on her and I found her character really annoying. HOWEVER..

Once it gets going the film gets better and better. Katy becomes a great character and all the characters development and arcs on a whole were truly phenomenal! For me the best part of the film was the characters and seeing them all develop throughout.

So is the plot good? To be blunt, yes! It's truly unique and uniquely done in so many ways, I don't want to give out anything that would spoil anything, but it's really not what you expect. That's all I say!



I'll shut up now! I'll just say it's well worth watching. It's a great ""superhero"" to have and a great one to watch. And overall it's a fun, visually pleasing and brilliant watch. I recommend.","I have to say I was looking forward to this one. First film in a while that had no connection to avengers etc so I was intrigued to see how they would do this.

1222,1222,Really enjoyable film 7/10,"Shang - Chi is the new hero of the MCU and everyone is going to love him. Although I have a really deep criticism over fase 4 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I've decided to go watch the movie in theaters (after two years of being away from theaters due to covid). Overall I really enjoyed it. There were still a few moments that I regretted and that were dull. Not to mention ""little mistakes"" that Marvel keep doing with their movies. In general it was a fun experience. The plot didn't have much to offer to be honest: another origin story of a superhero that tries to run away from his fate and responsibilities. Until he is forced to face his past.

This has been the kind of way for Marvel to introduce their new characters in the MCU, I wished they would have been more creative but they do deliver creativity for once. Watching people speak their native language for once was a huge step up for Marvel. The movie is also influenced by many other asian classic films such as ""Hero"", ""Hidden Dragon"", ""Seven Samurai"" and ""In the mood for love"".

Of course it wouldn't be a Marvel movie without some end credits scenes (how original). The end credit scene does confirm the return of Shang Chi at some point, but what the end credits scene does confirm moreover is how the future Marvel films will all get connected. As I said before, I'm less optimistic with this whole fase 4 of Marvel but it wouldn't hurt or kill to watch a few of them. To me, I just wanted to return to the theaters.

Speaking of actors: Simu Liu is a fantastic actor and will definitely become a fan favorite, both him and his character. Awkwafina steals the show every single time she's on screen. Tony Leung is wonderful and acts so well. The whole cast is perfect. If you are in favor of theaters and Marvel movies than go watch Shang Chi.

P. S: the end credit song - Fire in the Sky by Anderson Paak. Is the best part of the movie.","Shang - Chi is the new hero of the MCU and everyone is going to love him.

1223,1223,Shang-chi and the legend of the ten rings,"I have just watched this movie. I am an avid Marvel fan. This film introduces a new character, there is that standard Disney approach, with a mix of comedy, seriousness and lots of action.

Disney work through the numbers on this film, there are no surprises and it does what it does on the tin.

The acting is good, special effects are solids and the story is not bad.

There's continuity linking to the other marvel universe which is nice for the fans.

I would actually pitch this at 7.5/10, not quite an 8 but higher than a 7

Those review of 1 or 2 out of ten are way off the mark, this film is not that bad.","I have just watched this movie. I am an avid Marvel fan. This film introduces a new character, there is that standard Disney approach, with a mix of comedy, seriousness and lots of action.

1226,1226,Awesome.,"Best fight scenes since the civil war airport scene. They mess up simply by trying to make the character 10 years younger then the actor is. But aside from that I thought it was awesome. Plenty of cool action fight scenes, goes a little off the rails at the end with way too much cgi for what was a relatively grounded movie to start. Great addition to MCU , especially after the quality level the shows have been.","Best fight scenes since the civil war airport scene.

1228,1228,Refreshing and Captivating!,"""I gave you ten years to live your life. And where did that get you? You walked in my shadow.""

Marvel Studios' Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings follows Shang-Chi, a seemingly ordinary young man from San Francisco who parks cars for a living alongside his friend, as must confront the past he thought he left behind when he is drawn into the web of the mysterious Ten Rings organization. Marvel took a big chance on this project. Of course we've had lesser known heroes end up getting their own movie franchise within the MCU, but Shang-Chi is not one many know about. Little was known going in other than we'd get some action scenes and explore new territory within the MCU. What they managed to do with Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings is unlike any Marvel movie yet. Destin Daniel Cretton takes a new approach that works wonders. His previous works of Short Term 12 and Just Mercy are heartfelt dramas so something big like this is new territory, but he incorporates the same style and messages into this. The dysfunctional family dynamic serving as the character arc and forming the conflict is so much deeper than some random business guy who wants to rule the world. With this story, it's easy to connect with it and understand character motives. I will say there's a lot to pack in here and the story can get muddy at points, but it pulls itself together that we retain most of everything.

Simu Liu is fantastic in the title role. Previous to watching, I hadn't seen him in anything. But he has all the skills as an emerging actor to be a household name. Shang-Chi is an interesting character to follow. As he discovers and recalls moments from his upbringing, we can slowly piece him together. There's much more to be made from him, but with future installments we'll be able to get much more. And Tony Chiu-Wai Leung is perfectly cast as Xu Wenwu. He's a villain I can understand, like, and dislike all at the same time. He's flawed, but there's depth to him. And he almost steals the show by the end with another showcase of mad acting skills. But the character I've been thinking of a lot, and mainly because she was so hilarious, is Awkwafina as Katy. Awkwafina is one of my favorite actresses working right now, especially after her role in The Farewell, and she smashes this. Katy is the typical comedic sidekick but so much fun. One of the funniest jokes comes from her and I was laughing hysterically. Maybe more character will come from her later, but what we got was enough for me. I can't wait to see her again! I should also mention Meng'er Zhang as Xialing. This is her first role and she's also great. What they'll do with her next should be interesting.

From a technical standpoint, this is impressive for a Marvel movie. There are some stunning visuals. The cinematography isn't that gray color scheme used in most, though it does fall into that later on, and bursting with color. And as you probably know, the visual effects are as good as they come. It's not muddled with CGI and a scene that was completely green screen, which is nice to see. Also, Marvel has been doing great with the themes and score lately because this is another great one, along with the soundtrack. Paired with this are the best fight scenes out of the whole MCU. The stunt choreography is top notch and is beautiful and intense to look at. The bus scene early on is the best yet and will be hard to top! Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings just really did it for me and most everybody can agree. It's refreshing and captivating in every way. Marvel has been taking some big leaps with this new phase and it gets me more and more excited for each new installment!","""I gave you ten years to live your life. And where did that get you?

1232,1232,Shang-Chi and the legend of The Ten Rings - enjoyably unMarvellous film. 80%,"""Shang-Chi and the legend of The Ten Rings"" is a superhero origin story which seems more like a Chinese martial arts film than the next entrant in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Many years ago I saw ""Crouching tiger, hidden dragon"" and found the fight scenes in that literally unbelievable a lot of the time. ""Shang-Chi"" often seems subtle in its fight scenes by comparison but then does have action sequences which are more like MCU superhero films. As an origin story, it assumes no familiarity with the MCU and in fact plays mostly as a non-MCU film, which is what I liked about it.

Simu Liu plays Shang-Chi/Shaun, the son of a mobster, Xu Wenwu (played by Tony Leung) who could quite easily have been the subject of a film or franchise himself, due to his legendary characteristics. Shang-Chi's mother Ying Li (played by Fala Chen) is also a legendary kind of character. This contrast of 'Eastern' legendary figures and 'Western' MCU legendary figures worked to the former's advantage, as the latter often come across as plastic toy figurines being used in a sandpit by small boys to play with.

The plot concerns how Shang-Chi/Shaun sought to move from under the shadow of his father to become his own man but just when he thought he was out, he is pulled back into Wenwu's orbit. The film mixes the seriousness, perhaps, of Chinese martial arts films with the jokey style of American Hollywood films. As should be expected from a MCU film, eventually the fate of the world will come into play and someone will have to play the hero to save it.

The martial arts in this film juxtaposes frenetic fight sequences with elegant and fluid fight scenes which have their own particular charm. Other times the action sequences seem lifted from a Disney live action family film and that was enjoyable too, if you just suspended disbelief.

Speaking of comedy, I found the earliest instance of this to be aiming very low for laughs, which isn't uncommon in MCU films but I warmed to later instances of it. For instance, I was amused by the character of a thespian who sounded like he was from Liverpool, when he reminisced about what he took from a film that he saw as a teenager and how that inspired him to get into acting. That actor playing the thespian did seem familiar, perhaps for his voice but I did recognise his name in the closing credits and remembered the role that he is perhaps best known for.

An interesting aspect to this film is its subject matter, i.e. An Asian superhero and a mostly Asian cast. Is this another attempt by Hollywood to crack the now important Chinese market? If it is, then the cooling relations between the US and China is an unwelcome fly in the ointment for Hollywood studios trying to make a lot of money from Chinese cinemagoers.

Another question that came into my mind was whether ""The Ten Rings"" is based on Chinese legend or is a Marvel appropriation of Chinese culture, tailored for 'Western' audiences that don't care about cultural authenticity. If it isn't the former, then I think that there could be a niche for films which mine authentic 'Eastern' legends and myths. That could be something which might interest me (Sinophiles would no doubt reel out a long list of films which have done just that!).

As you might have guessed, I wasn't the first in line to see this film. In fact, I wasn't even sure that I wanted to see it, as I haven't watched every line of superhero films in the MCU (maybe I should watch ""The Black Panther""?). As it stands, I think it was worth the punt in seeing it. I'd go so far as to say that seeing a sequel to this would be more appealing if it wasn't tied to The Avengers franchise! Furthermore, I would have liked this film not to remind that it was part of the MCU, which it managed to do, at least until the closing credits, which I didn't welcome when it made its first appearance. With that being said, this is the kind of film that you could watch again, after a suitable break. Although I didn't watch this film in 3D, it might be worth it to do so (as sometimes the extra cost of the ticket gives added value to the experience and...sometimes it doesn't).

Notes to self:

* The narrative did have some logical gaps in it, for example why Shang-Chi was attacked on the bus. What was that all about?

* The film was dedicated to the memory of Brad Allan, I think. Not sure who that was...searching now, a few websites list him as the supervising stunt coordinator.

* Reading the closing credits, I was reminded that this film was shot in Australia, which isn't obvious watching it, so, good job studio (I think I saw or heard something on ABC in Australia about how Asian Australians got to be in this film, perhaps a kung fu exponent or exponents)!

* My score for this film was tracking from 75% (7 out of 10 stars) to 75+% (8 out 10 stars) to just a flat 80% final score.","""Shang-Chi and the legend of The Ten Rings"" is a superhero origin story which seems more like a Chinese martial arts film than the next entrant in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU).

In fact, I wasn't even sure that I wanted to see it, as I haven't watched every line of superhero films in the MCU (maybe I should watch ""The Black Panther""?). As it stands, I think it was worth the punt in seeing it. I'd go so far as to say that seeing a sequel to this would be more appealing if it wasn't tied to The Avengers franchise! Furthermore, I would have liked this film not to remind that it was part of the MCU, which it managed to do, at least until the closing credits, which I didn't welcome when it made its first appearance. With that being said, this is the kind of film that you could watch again, after a suitable break. Although I didn't watch this film in 3D, it might be worth it to do so (as sometimes the extra cost of the ticket gives added value to the experience and...sometimes it doesn't).

Notes to self:

* The narrative did have some logical gaps in it, for example why Shang-Chi was attacked on the bus. What was that all about?

* The film was dedicated to the memory of Brad Allan, I think. Not sure who that was...searching now, a few websites list him as the supervising stunt coordinator.

* Reading the closing credits, I was reminded that this film was shot in Australia, which isn't obvious watching it, so, good job studio (I think I saw or heard something on ABC in Australia about how Asian Australians got to be in this film, perhaps a kung fu exponent or exponents)!

* My score for this film was tracking from 75% (7 out of 10 stars) to 75+% (8 out 10 stars) to just a flat 80% final score."
1233,1233,Phase Four is in Full Swing!,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings far surpassed any expectations I had. It's easily the best Marvel movie post-Infinity Saga (I know, that's not exactly saying much), and is very promising for the quality of Marvel's next projects. We have probably the second best villain intimately tied to the origin of a new, entertaining, and capable hero full of potential, in a story that ties the universe together and teases upcoming events in tantalising and unexpected ways. The fight choreography was on point, the dialogue was seeped in cultural significance, the jokes all land, and the CGI is some of the best since Thanos himself. Shang-Chi is an all-out success for Marvel, it seems in multiple ways - both critically and financially. Really its only downfall is that at times this doesn't feel like that much of a movie about Shang-Chi himself purely because his origin is tied so closely to the story of the Ten Rings. Instead it's a Ten Rings movie featuring Shang-Chi, which is fine, but feels a bit weird for his introduction into the MCU. And yes, the Ten Rings are tied up with the Iron Man films perfectly, almost making the whole Aldrich Killian thing better in retrospect. I give Shang-Chi a high 8/10, with promise of moving up with rewatches.","Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings far surpassed any expectations I had.

1234,1234,Feast for the eyes...,"I can't decide whether I loved this movie because it's great or if it's just the best cinematography Bill Pope's done since The Wachowski's ""The Matrix"" trilogy?

Either way, ""Shang-Chi"" is easily the most visually distinctive & stunning film in the MCU thus far - vibrant, kinetic, gorgeously framed / composed, with its own individualistic sense of personality - & the symbiosis between the fight choreography & camera work supercedes that of any previous installment in the Marvel franchise - resulting in an incredible style that works effortlessly throughout... I can't stress this enough - some moments are honestly breathtaking (my jaw was on the floor) & it's an utter joy to see such expertly constructed & perfectly timed sequences - of pure, unapologetic cinema - unfold. Allows the audience the uncommon opportunity to just sit back & relax whilst watching, safe in the knowledge those responsible for bringing the screenplay to life are trustworthy, capable hands. Hence, the creator's dependability reassures viewers that they can simply focus on enjoying the experience instead, making it even more fun.

Although I shouldn't be surprised everything's captured so masterfully - considering the reliably quirky inventiveness of the visionary director of photography at the helm of the project - despite his legendary status, I still wasn't expecting a solo film (made by such an infamously corporate production company which normally shuns creative experimentation of any kind, churning out unadventurous, generic, copy + paste origin stories) to be so shockingly well realised on screen, it would consequently make ""Avengers: Endgame"" look embarrassingly trivial & unengaging by comparison... Yet somehow, under the watchful eye of director Destin Daniel Cretton, together, this duo manage to accomplish exactly that successfully, capturing scenes with a unique confidence I rarely (if ever) see in recent comic book adaptations.

For instance, usually, I can't stand the bland, dull, grey, lifeless aesthetics of Disney movies (renowned for their very ugly colour grading & over reliance on CGI) but the filmmaking here feels as uncharacteristically bold, audacious, awe inspiring, original, immersive & as epic as James Wan's ""Aquaman"" or James Cameron's ""Avatar"", utilising VFX effectively to enhance the scale of the tale being told, rather than detract from the overall plot. Of course, technically impressive world building & enormous scale / grandiosity are meaningless qualities & hollow attributes to possess if the narrative lacks depth or engaging characters but thankfully, this offers just enough heart to additionally feel emotionally investable, as well as spectacular.

Wish I could've seen this in the theatre.","I can't decide whether I loved this movie because it's great or if it's just the best cinematography Bill Pope's done since The Wachowski's ""The Matrix"" trilogy?

1240,1240,Surprisingly good.,"I have to say that this was a surprisingly good movie. I say surprisingly because Marvel (or DC for that matter) have not exactly excelled in making even decent movies for quite some time. That the woke ""critics"" on Rotten Tomatoes gave it high ratings was a bit of a red flag as well but not only was the movie rather free from woke ramblings and preaching but it was a very fun and entertaining movie to watch.

The movie starts off in a somewhat bizarre way with Shang-Chi and his girlfriend swiping a car from a valet parking and going for a joy ride. It turns out that they are telling their story to a couple of friends and that is pretty much how this movie is told.

It begins more or less right away with some nice action and it continues that away with plenty of action sequences intermixed with story telling. The action and martial arts is really good in my opinion. They are in stark contrast to the mediocre rubbish we were treated to in Snake Eyes. The latter which was quite a disappointment.

This movie relies heavily on fantasy elements with tie ins to Doctor Strange, especially towards the end. Another movie that I liked a lot by the way. Thus there are of course plenty of special effects and CGI. Most of them good or very good. I really liked the beautiful world of Ta Lo. The combat scenes, especially when the rings are in action are both cool and beautiful.

There are quite a lot of comical relief in the movie as well and, for once, it is not to silly, outrageous or plain stupid. It contributes well to the enjoyment factor of the movie. The washed out actor is a bit on the limit but otherwise it works well with the rest of the movie. That guy on the bus starting to film and make commentaries was quite hilarious for instance.

The story? Well it is a Marvel special effects movie so one should not expect too much but the story is not bad. It mostly holds together and works well enough to tie all the action together. The acting is pretty much the same thing. One should not expect too much but it is good enough. It was nice to see Michelle Yeoh as Ying Nan though. She was one of the few cool characters in Discovery and she does know how to act.

Overall I very much enjoyed this movie. It is a simple super hero and fantasy adventure story with lots of action and special effects and with the single purpose of entertaining the audience that doesn't fall in the trap of trying to ""educate"" said audience.","I have to say that this was a surprisingly good movie.

1241,1241,Surprisingly entertaining for MCU's 4th phase,"Now that we're finally into the fourth phase of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, we're getting to see the deep cuts from everyone's favorite superhero community. Despite having an unnecessarily long title, 'Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings' is a fun ride that doesn't feel like a retread of Marvel films past.

The introduction to Shaun (Shang-Chi, portrayed by Simu Liu) is handled well, as the character is likable and feels like a good fit among the established members of S. H. I. E. L. D. Comic relief comes in the form of Awkwafina's Katy - sidekick to Shaun - and an atypical showing by Sir Ben Kingsley, while more serious performances are delivered by veteran actors Tony Chiu-Wai Leung and Michelle Yeoh.

As for the plot, it can almost be split in two, as the first and second halves of 'Shang-Chi' feel like completely different films. The first half is very unserious and comes off as a companion to the latest 'Spider-man' entries, whereas the second half is a more traditional Marvel action-drama. Even though there are plenty of typical superhero tropes thrown in here with even more of a Disney imprint than past MCU movies, it's still enjoyable for what it is.

The somewhat surprising strength of 'Shang-Chi' suggests there's no slowing down in the MCU film factory.","Now that we're finally into the fourth phase of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, we're getting to see the deep cuts from everyone's favorite superhero community.

1242,1242,Sort of disappointed..,"I got to admit I wasn't particularly blown away by anything in the movie.. I might even say ""I was bored"" by it.

Don't get me wrong.. it IS a spectacle! The action is great. The locations are nice, costume design, sound design, etc. But it is overall a soft release not worth seeing in theaters.. specially as a follow-up to what Endgame was.

The biggest problem for me, is how the underwritten lead has muddled personality (for reasons covered in the story) devoid of charm, personality or good dialogue.

The next issue is the humor, which didn't land for me.. Not once. The supporting lead Awkwafina isn't her normal ""loud"" self that's supposed to be funny every time she opens her mouth. Her role is very supportive and a little dramatic. And while I questioned myself why was she even there for, it doesn't ultimately matter. She is another forgettable character that is given more importance than the role deserves.

Finally, the third act is weak. There's a balancing problem with stakes. You can't feel tension or weight to any action. And there's a lot of superficial ""I can't do it"" until they can.

In the end, this feels like a very safe plot, written in a way to appeal to china (considering how the Mandarin is portrayed), that ends up appealing to no one specific. Certainly doesn't feel like a Marvel movie.. but it was bound to happen if we are to be introduced to different aspects of the narrative. But it also doesn't feel like a comic book. It's more generic than that.","I got to admit I wasn't particularly blown away by anything in the movie.. I might even say ""I was bored"" by it.

1244,1244,Bold & Brilliant,"A bold step for the MCU, incorporating an Eastern cinema approach into it's franchise. With it's foundations built on choreography and humour, Shang-Chi beautifully brings in elements of famed Kung-Fu films and Chinese culture.

The cast, perhaps largely unknown in most of the world, perform excellently and those performances are centred on the movements within the film. Taking inspiration from many martial arts, the action scenes - whilst exaggerated and outlandish in comparison to the film's peers - are brilliant. The addition of Kingsley is truly excellent too, as he and Awkwafina provide the majority of laughs.

A standalone plot whilst maintaining links to the MCU, Shangi-Chi creates a new platform for Marvel to explore, although clearly sets up the next Phase along with other releases from the year. The standout element is the creation of the new world and it's creatures though, a huge Disney budget bringing to life fabled animals long deserving of a spotlight.","A bold step for the MCU, incorporating an Eastern cinema approach into it's franchise.

1245,1245,Shang Chi and the legend of the ten rings,,
1246,1246,The Master of Kung-fu,"Shang chi and the legend of the ten rings we follow the story of a guy named Shang(Simu Liu) who lives your basic life In San Francisco. Working as a Valet parking car, and partying late nights with his best friend Katy(Awkwafina). Until one day a band of assassins targets Shang and it's revealed that he's actually an assassin trained at birth by his father Wenwu(Tony Leung Chiu-Wai). The leader of the ten rings an ancient Chinese organization that's existence for thousands of years, conquering kingdoms and overthrowing governments. Now Shang-Chi must faces his father and overcome the demons of his past. Each of these Marvel films I find most enjoyable is the world building, set up of this universal series. All these characters from various backgrounds and classes and worlds. Shang-Chi I can say is one of those welcome new additions. Similar to Guardians of the galaxy when this was announced I hadn't the slightest idea who this guy was. Usually when people think Martial artists with marvel they usually think Iron fist or daredevil. So going into this I had a blank expectation of what to see. It does pay tribute to old-school martial arts films while mixing fast action charm of a comic book with a blend of Chinese mythology and philosophy. It does helps gives the movie an identity and the characters overall I found them good not great, but I found them entertaining and likable. Shang's more or less just an ordinary guy just trying to live his life. Have fun make a new start and make the best of it. He's honestly more or less happy with his basic life. Though at the same time running from his old life his father,mother and sister. It all leaves an impact on him as a person. He's pretty emotional not Peter Parker emotional, but he still has a personality outside of just having a stoic Shaolin fighter serious persona. They could have easily done a chosen one theme with him that been done to death. He likes to joke and have fun along with his friend Katy. Awkwafina I'm not a fan of her I didn't really care for her in crazy Rich Asians or Raya and the last dragon. Here I found her character more funny and likable. She doesn't really come off as that annoying friend that's more or less in the way. Her and Simu do play well off each other and display this friendship of two different people who still very similar. I got sort of Rush hour vibe off them, there's even a fight scene outside on a bamboo scaffolding. She's not just a pointless tagalong she does have moments where the jokes don't work , though she does add to the film specifically in the finale. The tone of the movie still finds time to flesh them out. More or less the two of them are just goofballs at the beginning, once more's revealed it does take time to have it's more deep serious moments. Wenwu I found to be a really good villain and While technically this still isn't really the Mandarin that comic readers we're probably expecting. His overall character is very compelling he more borders the line like killmonger. You understand his reasons though his actions are unjustifiable. He does still manages to gives off this somewhat opposing demeanor not from his fighting, but from the way he present his self. I buy this guy used to be a tyrant and a Conqueror. I still wish his rings worked the same way though, really he just throws them like chakra and whips them around. As for the sister she's given minimal in this not really alot of moments. Outside of her childhood flash backstory it's clear later down the road their gonna do something her. The visuals are stunning to this one water effect the just pops off the screen. The use of elements being shown through the right use of slow motion. The landscape of Tao lo which has this very traditional Chinese style with Nine-tail foxes, and Fu dog(lions) that make that the rhinos from black panther looks bad. I want to see more places like this in future installments. A lot of these cg effects are on par with doctor strange.","Shang chi and the legend of the ten rings we follow the story of a guy named Shang(Simu Liu) who lives your basic life In San Francisco.

1247,1247,Simply entertaining,"When shang chi was announced in phase 4, i got excited because i am a fan of martial arts films. But after the pandemic, i slowly started losing interest in the film because i felt that mcu won't be as good after endgame and my fear turned true with the post endgame movies. None of the films or series satisfied me. I saw shang chi with low expectations and got fully satisfied.

What i loved about shang chi the most was its entertaining. Post endgame, mcu got burdened with expectations to connect their films into a universe, set up future films and do something different but in that process forgot to provide entertainment. On the other hand, shang chi is not burdened with any of these and tells a simple and independent story. There is no deliberate connecting to the mcu, nor they are in a hurry to set up any sequels, also its not anything different as its a typical Chinese martial arts mythological film. The action scenes in train and skyscraper were mindblowing and best hand to hand action scenes after winter soldier(which black widow failed to provide). The female stars were also badass. The climax cgi action was okay.

Only drawback is there is nothing new in the plot as its that typical mcu storyline where our hero has daddy issues.

On the whole, shang chi and the legend of ten rings is a very good standalone mcu film after thor ragnarok.","When shang chi was announced in phase 4, i got excited because i am a fan of martial arts films.

The climax cgi action was okay.

Only drawback is there is nothing new in the plot as its that typical mcu storyline where our hero has daddy issues.

On the whole, shang chi and the legend of ten rings is a very good standalone mcu film after thor ragnarok."
1248,1248,Exciting and heartwarming,,
1249,1249,A diverse new addition,"Shang Chi and the Legend of the Ten rings is one of the marvel's first phase 4 movies. In hindsight it has a underlying tone and story similar to that of Black Panther. Both being representations of certain groups and and their cultures.

The story is solid. It wasn't perfect as it had some minor flaws. A bit cheesy with good writing and comedy but nothing exceptional. The fight scenes , the choreography and dragons were cool which were refreshing compared to the last couple of MCU movies that were released. The characters are nothing to interesting other than Shang Chi and his dad and their whole dynamic.

Overall an enjoyable film. An eyecandy with some flaws but nonetheless was watchable and likable.

1250,1250,"What a waste of time, the other way around geographically","Too unrealistic movie, with too much special effect that they do not bother to cover up. Humoristic moments do not seem that funny. Also, how a thin someone holdoff a big guy?

Ugh, it is that classic moves of Hollywood and phrases. Like the headphone did not hear you. Or foreigner moving oversea. Suddenly it looks like how they are picturing America especially in the cab. Like your pants joke, hell no phrase when looking at height. Or was looking everywhere for you. Burn it down. Classic moves like using multiple people as a stair.

Hate it also that sometimes they just speak English but mostly Chinese, wondering what they want.

How much did the Chinese pay Disney?

Using big actors and adding a new guy in to keep the quality of the acting, with a bad script it does not do well. Especially when there is no innovative action in the players. They were copy and paste from another movie they played before.

Classic scenarios making it so predictable, and fights that could not be won due to lack of experience are own suddenly.

Acting is below average, quality of screen is high but too much special effect, camera work is OK because it has gotten took over multiple of times by special effects so can not give any real points. Sound is below average because they're using too much overused kinds.

1 time only movie. Points are given to the cast because they still try to make something out of it but still not pulling tit off and meeting the script only. Some points for the innovativeness idea.","Too unrealistic movie, with too much special effect that they do not bother to cover up. Humoristic moments do not seem that funny.

1251,1251,Destin Daniel Cretton; you've done it again!,"Marvel's latest feature introduces cinephiles to Shaun AKA Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) a martial arts master and a character created by Steve Englehart and Jim Starlin, first appearing in a Marvel publication back in 1973. Beginning in the first of many gorgeously choreographed and shot sequences, we're introduced to Shang-Chi's father Xu Wenwu (Tony Chiu-Wai Leung) and mother Li (Fala Chen) also entailing the awesome power of the Ten Rings which Xu currently has in his possession. What follows is a heart-pounding and ridiculously entertaining adventure movie with true heart.

Filled with beautiful performances not least from everyone already mentioned and including Awkwafina as Shaun's best friends Katy and Meng'er Zhang as sister Xialing, there's plenty here to adore on screen not even getting to the truly awe-inspiring action set pieces with the best fight scenes I've seen in recent memory. Cretton (Short Term 12, Just Mercy) is very quickly becoming one of my favourite directors having produced three incredible pieces of cinema in the last 8 years. It's great to see that his passion for storytelling and independent spirit still shines through his latest here while also staying true to the Marvel fan base (I really did not expect a certain character to show up but made for some really comical moments).

The visual effects are of course stunning but what makes them stand out here are how they're incorporated with the beautiful landscapes to enhance the feeling of authentically experiencing Shaun's heritage and getting wrapped up in the culture that the filmmakers so wonderfully explore. This is how origin stories should be made! The creature design is also incredible and is an integral element to making the final sequences all the more breathtaking.

Please do yourselves a favour and see this on the biggest screens possible, please support your local cinema and stay safe my friends.","Marvel's latest feature introduces cinephiles to Shaun AKA Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) a martial arts master and a character created by Steve Englehart and Jim Starlin, first appearing in a Marvel publication back in 1973.

1252,1252,Not a good movie,"This movie was a fist in the face or rather a razor fist. I don't know if the movie is bad or I can't watch Marvel movies anymore but I didn't like anything about this movie, neither the story, nor the special effects, nor the acting. It all seemed too exaggerated and predictable, plus two hours is really too much for a movie of this type.

The only interesting parts were the first minutes where you see the meeting between the parents and the clash between the abomination and the monk whose name I don't remember.

I think instead the worst part was the final battle, even the too long and exaggerated one.","This movie was a fist in the face or rather a razor fist.

This is the first time I felt sleepy for an action movie. I feel like i wasted my money, despite availing the Super Tuesday offer. The Suicide Squad was far much better in terms of storyboard.

The first half of the film was very good, the story, and especially the impressive fight scenes. However, later in the film we constantly get some new elements, the story expands, there is not always an explanation, and the worst part of the film was my last fight because I think they went too far with special effects, for me personally it was not watchable. The bad guys overall were just solid, nothing special. Of course, at the end of the film we have a scene that shows us how to look for (at least) another film.","Solid pop corn film.

1255,1255,Finally something good again from Marvel,"Marvel has not done much good lately. 2 horrible TV shows, and 1 bad TV show. Not a single good movie since Captain Marvel, and nothing seemingly good coming over the horizon.

To be honest I have started to give up. Marvel have produced magnificent movies and great entertainment for many years, but lately it is like that magic has come off and they seem much more run of the mill basic with that, by now, boring Marvel feel. Marvel has tried to introduce more political correctness, more feminism, and more nonsense diversity, and it has all failed.

This movie however is not a failure.

Why?

This movie is simple, it is to the point, it follows tropes, cliches, and it is a classic heroes journey - which is exactly why it works!

Marvel took a classical story we all heard, read and seen before but they switched a few things around, kept some of that Marvel feel, and made it play out mainly in China and almost only with Chinese actors. And it works!

Imagine that? Sure you can find some political nonsense if you look hard enough, but who cares when you have great fight scenes, lovely sceneries, a great (but basic) story and brilliant well written characters.

We even get a villain that you understand, sympathise with and even feel a sting of ""ah, too bad"" about him.

This is how you make an action movie! Great stuff Marvel!

The points I deduct is due to the movie not being that amazing. They pull the heroes journey of sure, but we have also seen it done better. Sound is great, but not amazing, directing is great, but not amazing, etc. Etc. Everything about this movie is high class, greatly done, and well performed, but it is not on top, it is not amazing nor perfect.

I also have a few objections about the background story and the ending, but I am keeping this spoiler free so...

8/10. This is a great movie and highly entertaining, and definitely worth the ticket price. Go see and get your faith in Marvel restored.","Marvel has not done much good lately. 2 horrible TV shows, and 1 bad TV show.

1258,1258,"Definite 10 of 10! At the very top tier of MCU movies - characters, lore, acting, action, fighting, visual effects! :-)","The entire cast was perfect, especially Simu Liu, Awkwafina, Tony Leung, Michelle Yeoh, Ben Kingsley, and Ronny Chieng! :-) Spectacular visual effects -and- awesome fight scenes! :-)","The entire cast was perfect, especially Simu Liu, Awkwafina, Tony Leung, Michelle Yeoh, Ben Kingsley, and Ronny Chieng! :-) Spectacular visual effects -and- awesome fight scenes! :-)"
1259,1259,"With Shang-Chi, Marvel presents their first Asian superhero in a good and cultural way.","Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is a new superhero movie in the Marvel film series. The film is directed and written in part by Destin Daniel Cretton, the director of Short Term 12 and Just Mercy.

The film is about Shaun (Simu Liu), who tries to put his past behind him and just wants to enjoy his life with his best friend Katy (Awkwafina). When the mysterious organization the Ten Rings finds Shaun, he is forced to confront his past after all. To do this, he must take his birth name Shang-Chi again, to protect Katy and his sister Xialing (Meng'er Zhang) from the actions of the Ten Rings and their leader Xu WenWu the Mandarin (Tony Chiu-Wai Leung) who is also Shaun. His father.

This film is Marvel's first superhero film starring an Asian actor. Furthermore, with this film they also bring out the Asian culture and fighting styles well. For this they have used other movies like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon as an example. Fans of this film can recognize moments that refer back to these films. They portray the fight scenes where characters fight each other with Asian fighting styles well and entertainingly. The art of the Asian fighting style is somewhat overshadowed when characters use more supernatural powers in the film. Fight scenes where this happens are less exciting and entertaining than scenes where characters fight each other in more normal ways.

At one point, the film also feels like you're watching a live-action mix of the Asian animation shows Pokémon and Avatar: The Last Airbender. These scenes provide some extra comedy and are especially more entertaining for younger viewers. The movies and costumes of the film cast also help with the emergence of Asian culture in the film. The visual effects are also put to good use in the film. Except for a few scenes, it can be seen that they have used a green screen for the background, but fortunately this is not disturbing in the film. Creatures can also be returned before the start of the film. A bit redundant on a few action scenes with 3D effects in the film.

The acting is well done by the film cast. Simu Liu took to Twitter to ask Marvel to play the part, with both parties quickly making a good deal. Simu Liu comes across as good and charismatic as the lead of the film and further conveys the action sequences beautifully. Along with Awkwafina, he also has good chemistry in the film and together provide good appropriate humor. The comedy also doesn't overshadow all the dramatic aspects in the film, which sometimes does happen. Tony Chiu-Wai Leung also portrays the villain of the film in a good and sympathetic way, so that as a viewer you understand why he does what he is doing to me. This film is also only his first English-language role in an American film. Although this is only his first time, he still delivers good and appropriate acting. Meng'er Zhang does not get that much time in the film, but a bit less good or present in the film.","Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is a new superhero movie in the Marvel film series.

The storyline was alright but the CG was very good. They used lots of Chinese culture tradition, costume & symbols. Looking forward to see the next sequel.","When the movie first started...

Though it had a predictable plot just like other Disney films, due to its brilliant execution you'll be glued to the screen. Awkwafina as Katy was my favourite character of the film as all the comedy punches were delivered through her character.

There is no humour. No sense of fun. It feels like a generic kung fu movie and that we have seen it all before.. I saw the ending way before we got there and above all, it was boring.

Awkwafina was intensely annoying as ever with her grating personality and spouting exposition all the time.

The only critical issue is that this movie has Awkwafina, so you know you'll have to suffer through some pointless yelling which seems to be intented as funny, but never really is.","Marvel delivers.

It depends a lot on the visual effects, its main characters can be funny but not nice, the story does not generate much interest and we have seen the fights many times and in a better way in almost any film produced in Hong Kong, Indonesia or Thailand of the last twenty years. The only thing that saves this film is the karaoke scene that is unexpectedly welcome. The rest is routine, mediocre, tiring and bland.","Let's agree that it is a bad movie from multiple points of view.

I think it's a good thing to have such a major and big representation of Asian characters, especially nowadays with Anti-Asian hate/crime rising. The film had a pure theatrical release, instead of the Black Widow treatment (which also was available on Disney plus and the cinemas at the same time) The movie does not have that as a topic, it is entertainment after all, but in every promo and interview that the actors were involved it was something that was mentioned.

1273,1273,Another fabulous addition to MCU's Phase 4!,"The much-awaited Shangi Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings released today in theatres. It follows the journey of Shang Chi (Simu Liu), the son of the famed MCU villain the Mandarin, who revolts against his father to fight evil.

The first stand-alone film featuring an Asian American superhero, Shang Chi understandably stands out with its close combat sequences. All the actors and especially Simu Liu have undergone extensive martial arts training and it shows, with a sensational sequence on a moving bus in San Francisco and another on a bamboo scaffolding in Macau, the standouts.

Awkwafina and a surprise returning character from the MCU provide genuine, sarcasm-laced comedy that adds another wonderful layer to the experience. Cameos from Benedict Wong and Ronnie Chieng also manage to leave the audience in spits.

Without stooping to cultural appropriation, with an all-Asian crew, director Destin Daniel Cretton pays rich tribute to Chinese heritage at every turn. Hong Kong's superstars Tony Leung and Michelle Yeoh are electric in their roles and the fact that they don't seem to have lost a step with age, acing their action sequences, shows their dedication as performers.

Regarded as one of the finest actor's Chinese cinema has every produced, Tony Leung stamps his class all over the film, giving an engrossing, captivating performance as the dreaded leader of the Ten Rings.

His inner moral dilemmas and love/hate relationship with his children are portrayed brilliantly by the man nicknamed 'Small Tiger' among the Five Tiger Generals of Hong Kong Cinema

The flashback sequences help to build up Shang Chi as a character and intricately captures his upbringing as the heir-apparent to a genocidal megalomaniac, and how despite wanting nothing to do with his father's murderous tendencies, as his son, he is inadvertently drawn to the Mandarin's world of violence and carnage.

The films delves into mystical elements towards the climax and with two surprise-laden post-credit sequences tie into both Doctor Strange's world of Mystic Arts as well as a possible connection that the Ten Rings has to alien technology.

As always, the way weaves in each individual fim character to the wonderful tapestry that makes up each of its Phases is a joy in itself.

It is due to the well-written characters and the nuanced acting of its performers that Shang Chi stands out while the eye-catching CGI and elaborately chorographer action sequences add more gloss to the end product.

Another wonderful new addition to the MCU world and hopefully this paves the way for more ethnicities being represented in the universe as time goes on.

Highly recommended. A must watch. Marvel's Phase 4 continues to raise the bar!","The much-awaited Shangi Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings released today in theatres.

1274,1274,Miscast,"I'm sorry but the leading man here is a definite miscast. Or is it because Tony Leung and Awkwfina stole the show? Hmmmmmm......

While the MCU movies are getting too formulaic I'm hesitant to say the next 10 year is starting out rather uninteresting. Shang Chi is basically a Chinese cash grab in the lineage of Black Panther. It is uninspiring, routine and CGI oriented.

Back to casting the main lead, I'm suggesting either John Cho (star trek, Cowboy Bobep,) or Chang Chen (Dune) would be an upgrade. While Falan Chen is sufficient the role is a thankless one. As to the story I would love to see more of grandma and take out Ben Kingsley's.

I mean Hawkeye series is better, if how so ever slightly. I understand the fantastic elements are tributes to the Chinese culture. Of course Kingsley and that strange pet is trying hard to be comedic but is rather forced. Overall it's a surface scratcher only. So disappointed.","I'm sorry but the leading man here is a definite miscast. Or is it because Tony Leung and Awkwfina stole the show? Hmmmmmm......

Thanks to scintillating cast who lit up the screen especially charismatic Tony Leung.

Chemistry between Simu & Awkwafina as besties are undeniably good.

Action scenes including CGI works definitely made some nice highlights.

Simi Liu has nailed the new superhero character. The choreography was brilliant, the VFX was pretty well done, and the cast and crew did such an amazing job making this movie happen. I hope we get to see Shang-Chi once again, maybe in the new Avengers or the sequel if they make that happen in the future of the MCU.

1277,1277,I give it Ten Rings!,"Let me commence by saying this movie is by far one of the most-fun, action packed Marvel movies ever!

Simu Liu is the perfect Marvel protagonist, and Awkwafina delivers the obligatory yet welcomed dose of humor you'd come to expect from a Marvel presentation.

But beyond that this movie is rich with mythology, adventure, and incredible martial arts combat that cannot be described with another phrase other than breathtaking, to be the introduction of a new character the story is well-written and you feel as if he had been with us from the start,

I give this move the 10 it deserves, In Marvel We Trust.","Let me commence by saying this movie is by far one of the most-fun, action packed Marvel movies ever!

Every single actor/actress/character played their roles to perfection and everything was in balance throughout i.e. Comedy timing, amount of CGI and an excellent script. My favourite Chinese lady actress (of whose films I have seen nearly all), Michelle Yeoh, is her usual perfect self.

Everything that is good about the film has already been commented upon in most of the other reviews here so, all there is left to say is that its a great film for family, eastern fantasy and the toy that all the kids are going to beg parents for as a Christmas present (I won't say a name etc but when you get to the Ben Kingsley appearance part of the film, you will know of what I'm talking of).

Top notch film and best of the MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe) to date...after 'AVENGERS: ENDGAME (2019) of course.","This was a case of 3rd time lucky for me; as I was totally disappointed with the dismal, 'GHOST IN THE SHELL' and the utterly abysmal 'SNAKE EYES' rubbish.

This movie is the Asian one, taking inspiration from Chinese Mythology and Kung-Fu in this action-adventure. Great fight scenes and chases expertly shot, the downside is that most of it looks entirely computer generated. The comedian I don't like made me disappointed again, but once the 2nd comedic side kick joined it was a lot more funny. Strong start, middling middle and an ending which lacked motivation.

That being said, the middle 45 minutes of this film had me nearly falling asleep, literally. The character development just couldn't hook me at all because it felt like they kept revisiting the same points.

On a positive note, the visuals and martial arts are absolutely spectacular. The first act of the film contains most of the martial arts and it is so crisp and well-choreographed. The final act flexes all of the CGI dollas and they make they already big budget stretch far, with some of the more impressive sights you will see in a Marvel movie so far. This movie didn't quite hit the 8/10 for me to recommend people see it in theatres, but lets tack that up to me being tired and you go see it anyway!","Let me preface this by saying that my enjoyment of the movie may have been dampered by a poor night's sleep.

1285,1285,Vey Nice,"Thoroughly enjoyed watching this movie. Not one bit is boring and the comedy is really good and appropriate and not cringey like some other Marvel movies.

This is not an ""8"" 8 for me, but it's not a 7 either, more like 7.6 but then again, IMDb doesn't have half stars for some reasons.

The fight choreography is amazing and this one has some of the best hand-to-hand action in Marvel. It kinda gets ridiculous in the end and you feel like it's not in the MCU, but MCU is already ridiculous so this is not that far-fetched.

The acting of all of them was good especially the father.

The ""villain"" is really relatable and well-written, even though I felt like we needed more time with him, this much is enough to make you actually feel and understand why he does what he does and is kinda not the bad guy.

The story and characters could've used some more fleshing out, especially Shaun's sister.

Story and characters might be cliché but they use those clichés well and make you care about these characters and that's the most important part. I just wish there was more showing and not telling.

The CGI was not that good and it's really noticeable especially at the end. They should've worked on it more and polished it.

Not using gore and cuss words because they want their movies to be PG-13 really hurts these movies, even though they can use at least one f word but for some reason they don't, I'm not saying that f word can make the movie better, but sometimes you need something more than ""dam"" for the scene to be more impactful. Also, doesn't actually showing most of the flashbacks make them more impactful? Why does the camera turn away from the ""death"" scenes that can make the movie better? This is why not showing a little bit of blood and gore hurts these movies, these movies keep pulling their punches back, and believe me no one cares if you used some more gruesome scenes. How are you gonna make a Deadpool 3 and Blade movie then?

All in all, very enjoyable movie with good martial arts fights, characters, music choice, and a decent story. I might like it better when I see it a second time, but right now I'm kinda lukewarm about it. Really looking forward to seeing more of what Shang-Chi's gonna do in the MCU.","Thoroughly enjoyed watching this movie.

1287,1287,Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,"This movie was great, it was entertaining, it was fast paced, and it was unique. There were so many things I liked about this film. First off, I loved all the characters, such as Shang-Chi, Katy, Xu Wenwu, Xialing, Razor Fist, Death Dealer, the return of Trevor Slattery, Morris, and of course Master Guang Bo. The actors for all these characters were also perfect. They suited their roles perfectly. In my opinion, this movie had some of the best supporting characters in the MCU. I also loved the action. It was absolutely amazing, there were some points in the movie where I felt like I was watching a martial arts movie. The stunts and the choreography were perfect, I couldn't have asked for anything more. The effects in this movie were also stunning. The moving forest, the mythical creatures (especially the dragon), and the effects used on the Ten Rings were super cool. The effects in this movie were some of the best in the MCU. Lastly, I also loved the plot, it just sat really well with me.

This movie was like nothing we have ever seen before in the MCU. It was very unique and a nice twist for Marvel. The first Credit Scene was also very interesting and might have set up phase 4 in the MCU. This was a great movie, and I definitely recommend going to see it, even if you aren't a Marvel fan.","This movie was great, it was entertaining, it was fast paced, and it was unique.

1288,1288,A solid superhero adventure...,"Like many, I was concerned that this new Marvel Cinematic Universe saga would have trouble living up to previous standards but Shang-Chi has already left me hopeful for the series' future. I literally know nothing about this character but I found his film debut to be a solid superhero adventure; well acted, effectively character-driven, occasionally funny, rich with cultural representation and booming with swift and stylized martial arts action. It has what I hoped I was going to get from Black Panther: inclusivity AND an interesting world and narrative. I'm 100% all for representation but the story and characters must be pronounced, too and I just found this entry to be a lot more distinguished and captivating.

Although Shang-Chi treads the familiar origin story formula, there's a few fresh twists and turns that uniquely sets this character's journey apart from the others. Though the first half is decently entertaining with some identifiable drama and fast-paced yet slightly derivative set-pieces in urban environments, the second half is where the film really turns on (at least for me). The Chinese philosophy kicks in, the mythology is abundant, there's tons of visually striking imagery, a fantastical setting, loads of insane action choreography. The Asian representation is just off the chain and I was so enraptured by it. It doesn't feel contrived, I sensed a great deal of respect for it and all the while an engaging story was unfolding. A nice balance. I was very satisfied with what I saw. I'm really looking forward to seeing more of Shang-Chi's world and how it'll tie in with other stories yet-to-come. Very cool movie. Soulful, cultural and action-packed.","Like many, I was concerned that this new Marvel Cinematic Universe saga would have trouble living up to previous standards but Shang-Chi has already left me hopeful for the series' future.

The real Mandarin makes his debut and does not disappoint, Tony Chiu-Wai Leung was fantastic. All the other cast members were very likable as well.

Well, I was let down, and judging by the other reviews ALOT of other people were too. People are not going to put up with this crap for too much longer. I mean how many bad movies can Disney make in a row and expect people to continue to watch them?

I see Disney even tried to even throw some Anti American talk into this movie to try to get on China's good side....but even that did not work. China did not allow their citizens to watch it. I guess Disney will have to put even more Anti American talk into the next movie.

You messed up Star Wars Disney. Now you are messing up every Marvel movie. Maybe wokeness is not the way to go. PLEASE can someone buy Marvel from Disney before its too late??

1296,1296,Epic CGI Rendering and Battle Scenes.,"Story was ok and different from the rest, performances were on point and choreographies though a bit of dancing in some scenes were very accurate and convincing. What I really enjoyed and marvelled at most were the effects and fighting scenes. Marvel Studios really tops in this department always. The effects of the Ten Rings were amazing topped with serious blending in the fight scenes....made me enjoy this movie a lot and highly recommend it for the techies.","Story was ok and different from the rest, performances were on point and choreographies though a bit of dancing in some scenes were very accurate and convincing.

1297,1297,Worst story and plot ever.,"This is by far the most nonsensical plot in a Marvel film and one of the worst stories I've ever witnessed. It's so hard to make sense of anything at all in this film. The only good thing is some of the action sequences. Bus fight is spectacular but after that it goes completely downhill cause only after that does the plot actually unfold. And it is so ridiculous and so full of nonsense that I was thoroughly bored whenever anything other than the fight scenes were on.

I think Marvel is done. This phase seems completely relying on the success of the previous one. The only good thing is Spider-Man and I'm eagerly looking forward to No Way Home. After this I don't have any expectations from Marvel films other than Spider-Man.

The humour in this movie is pure cringe. It feels too forced and Awkwafina is completely out of place. The last scene where they sing Hotel California is so damn cringy. It's a tragedy that they thought people would enjoy it. This is a really bad film minus the action sequences. Watch it only for the action which looks good on the big screen. Don't have even the slightest expectation from the story.","This is by far the most nonsensical plot in a Marvel film and one of the worst stories I've ever witnessed.

Although Simu Liu falters a little bit as a leading man, he has a truly impressive cast to support him. Awkwafina is brilliantly funny and quippy as she always is. And Tony Leung, the complex antagonist and the hero's father, has the most depth in this film.

The visual effects are beyond beautiful. They reminded me of Ferngully, and the nature I observed as a child. Good stuff!

There are some surprising cameos that are both hilarious and wholesome.

With solid performances, great setpieces, fun action sequences, and some emotional depth and humour to it, it's the type of film you need to see on the big screen and just go along with the journey and fantastical elements. It's also paced well and intriguing for the runtime it has.

The direction is solid and the characters get a good amount of screen time each to develop and have well placed flashback sequences. The martial arts fights are pretty well done and the CGI creatures look interesting with their designs and have good special effects.

1313,1313,Marvel movies are like watching a family drama film from a Chinese series.,"A younger Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) is compelled to go back to his father's risky organization, The Ten Rings. He groups up together along with his excellent pal Katy (Awkwafina) and his estranged sister Xialing (Meng'er Zhang) to forestall Wenwu for good.

Shang-Chi And The Legend Of The Ten Rings mark MCU's first Asian-led superhero film. There had been Asian characters before, inclusive of Wong (Benedict Wong) from Doctor Strange and Hogun (Tadanobu Asano) from Thor. But they have constantly been sidekicks, flunkeys, or comedian relief.

Wenwu is a powerful crime lord who runs an evil empire constructed across the energy of ten historical earrings that he makes use of to generate blasts of energy.

Shang-Chi is a heart-warming tale syringed with humor. Co-writer-director Destin Daniel Cretton knows his circle of relative dynamics and superbly units the tone. Despite the humanity on show, it is the revolutionary martial arts that are the USP. The movement would not depend closely on virtual trickery withinside the actual world.

The chemistry among the actors is palpable, exuding an actual feel of a located own circle of relatives. The film's actual villain is grief, pushed via way of means of Wenwu at the cost of his children.

Shang-Chi is a prevailing mixture of the Chinese way of life and a hit Marvel formula. Despite pacing issues, it supplies a highly unique step withinside the proper path for Asian representation.

1314,1314,Surprisingly good!,,
1315,1315,Some Underwhelming Parts but very Good on the Whole,"I've been watching Marvel films for years and while I do almost always enjoy them I often come out underwhelmed, Shang Chi actually managed to pleasantly surprise me and while I do think it dragged slightly in the third act I really enjoyed it.

The film manages to balance it's humour and seriousness far better than other marvel property's and also incorporates aspects from other films without feeling too forced, instead adding to the worldbuilding. The action is possibly the best of any Marvel film and obviously takes a lot of influence from Jackie Chan films with I believe the stunt coordinator having worked with Chan in the past. The acting is all good with Simu Liu really shining and while I wasn't a massive fan of Awkwafina's character at the start I did find myself liking her development in the final act, I think Shang Chi manages to take what works so well about the MCU and polish it but this doesn't mean it's without it's flaws.

I did enjoy the emotional link between the villain and Shang Chi, but I thought that there were far too many flash backs telling us of how this relationship has developed, I also think that the third act was a bit of a let down with the action evolving into pretty basic CGI fights and most of the personal edge that lent itself so well to the rivalry between Shang Chi and Win Wu being lost. There are also some big plot holes and things that just don't make sense, the score is underwhelming and I'm not a massive fan of some of the villain's costume designs, however while this film does have it's flaws it was still a very enjoyable movie that I will likely watch again, the cast is good, cinematography different from the usual stuff the MCU has to offer and I like that Marvel didn't shy away from using a lot of subtitles and having characters speaking lot's of Chinese. Very enjoyable and I'd recommend it to any Marvel fan. 7/10.","I've been watching Marvel films for years and while I do almost always enjoy them I often come out underwhelmed, Shang Chi actually managed to pleasantly surprise me and while I do think it dragged slightly in the third act I really enjoyed it.

1316,1316,"""Welcome to the circus""","It's always fun to go to the theater for a new MCU production -- a chance to see something **new** that you know will be well produced and will keep on stretching their shared universe of superheros. With Shang-Chi it looks like their Phase 4 is well and truly launched, and you can already glimpse what Marvel Studios' overall approach is going to be. (More below.)

Just like Black Widow was Marvel's run at doing a James Bond-type film, Shang-Chi is their try at doing the Chinese martial arts thing. The result is a kind of compromise Westernized version that falls between two poles. For sure though, you'll be entertained. There's more than enough action, a lot of strikingly beautiful settings, and fun characters. But before I forget -- the mid-credits scene is one of the best they've ever done and totally worth staying for. (That's where the quote I put in the title above comes from -- a certain familiar character telling Shang-Chi to sure, come on in and join the craziness.) It does the usual thing of tossing the baton forward to whatever the next production will be, but it's stylistically so clever that it really stands out.

And the film itself: it fills up its 2:12 runtime with a whole lot of material and a lot of characters. Maybe too much. The third act in particular veers off onto a fantasy-type track that doesn't entirely fit well with the previous hour and a half of setup, and the scenes in that last section suddenly feel more rushed. Gone are the days of the first Iron Man or Thor or Ant-Man movies with their lean, linear storylines and single well defined themes. Instead, Marvel now seems to want to overstuff every one of their productions, even if they involve 'secondary' MCU characters, and turn them into epics. More and bigger is not always better, is it?

I did like the cast. Marvel always does an impressive job bringing in good people. Nice to see there are no less than 4 (!) major roles for females, as opposed to 2 for males, and they mix and match well. Of the mostly young cast though, I thought the older pair (Tony Leung, Michelle Yeoh) really stood out -- they effortlessly dominate the screen when they are on. Leung's character could have been a stock, one-dimensional scenery-chewing villain, but he's much more nuanced than that. Simu Liu (the lead role, Shang-Chi) is not exactly a great actor just yet, but he's athletic and cute and attractive with a sense of humor and for this role he doesn't need to be much more than that. Awkwafina, as Katy, does her usual turn with comic relief and side commentary with a dash of romance. As for Trevor Slattery (Ben Kingsley) -- that came out of nowhere and he's absolutely out of place, but somehow it works partly because of his pet that rises to Disney levels of cuteness.

About Phase 4. The first three cycles introduced and used particular major characters that were all required to fit under the Avengers umbrella. Now it's the post-Avengers era and from their scheduled series of releases up through 2023, we'll see a much more diverse slate of characters and stories that don't obviously fall under a single umbrella. If they do have a Master Plan for something equivalent to the Avengers, it's hard to see what it is. Maybe, they'll use this new freedom just to show us interesting stories in a bigger universe.","It's always fun to go to the theater for a new MCU production -- a chance to see something **new** that you know will be well produced and will keep on stretching their shared universe of superheros.

1320,1320,"""Shang-Chi"" Brings Balance to the MCU","For nearly ten years after its inception, the Marvel Cinematic Universe was dominated by the adventures of white men. Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow had to fight to get her own film this year, while her male co-stars got entire trilogies . ""Black Panther"" reinvigorated the franchise with its celebration of African culture in 2018, proving that the Marvel brand didn't have to be so beige. ""Captain Marvel"" became the first MCU film to be fronted by a woman. Now, ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" marks the first Asian-led film. Not only does the film feature the first Asian protagonist, it also features a predominantly Asian cast and crew, which, thankfully, give this franchise a much needed change in perspective.

The Ten Rings have been around for nearly a thousand years, gifting their wearer, Wenwu, immortality so that he may rule with unmatched strength. After centuries of building an empire out of blood, Wenwu was turned away from a life of violence by Ying Li, a guardian of the mystical land of Ta Lo. When heartbreak struck shortly after, Wenwu picked up the rings once again, causing him to go down a dark path, and his son, Shang-Chi, to run away to the United States. Now after ten years, the son must come home to confront his father and become who he was truly meant to be.

Similar to what Ryan Coogler was able to do with ""Black Panther"", co-writer/director Destin Daniel Cretton brings out the best of this new world as he is able to handle the mountains of establishing exposition. His use of flashbacks may be a bit liberal, especially as the film reaches its climax, but they're used meaningfully to build upon a story focused on character and culture.

Without a leading acting credit to his name, Simu Liu takes the titular role by storm as he navigates this typical hero's journey with charm and composure. Mixing a bit of T'Challa with Tony Stark, Shang-Chi is a hero battling with his past and future. Liu and Cretton strike a great balance as Liu hands himself over to Cretton's material in the somber moments, and Cretton lets Liu's comedic instincts light up the room.

Veteran Tony Leung brings the same melancholic energy to Wenwu as he did in his roles with Wong Kar-wai, particularly his work in ""In the Mood for Love."" Leung layers this villain and distances him from the average world dominator. He carries a stillness about him that inspires fear and compassion, two things that have made some of the greatest villains.

The overall narrative within a Marvel film is evenly composed of the plot and the action. Thankfully, Cretton blends both those halves together as he imbues the setpieces with the qualities of the wuxia genre, taking after such films as Ang Lee's ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" (also starring Michelle Yeoh) and Zhang Yimou's ""House of Flying Daggers."" The action often tells as much of the story as the dialogue, particularly in the gracefully dazzling opening sequence. But there's also room for brutality as the first act ends with a tower-scaffolding brawl where Shang-Chi's emotions turn him into a raw killer. Not since ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" has the action been so impactful on a technical and emotional level.

When allowed to be its own film, ""Shang-Chi"" is quite the spectacle. But when it gets forcefully molded into a Marvel film, the results are less than stellar. Even after all his work with the story and action, Cretton can't break free from the third-act visual effects extravaganza that holds this franchise like an iron vice. It's a shame as the smaller familial moments do more for the mind and soul than the forgettable litany of explosions that encompass the final thirty minutes. Being that this is the 25th film in the franchise, I've come to expect that level of disappointment.

Thanks to its multi-talented cast and crew, ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" is one of the better origin stories within the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The action may (rightfully) be the selling point, but the heart of the film lies within its characters, telling a familiar story on an impressive scale.","For nearly ten years after its inception, the Marvel Cinematic Universe was dominated by the adventures of white men. Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow had to fight to get her own film this year, while her male co-stars got entire trilogies . ""Black Panther"" reinvigorated the franchise with its celebration of African culture in 2018, proving that the Marvel brand didn't have to be so beige. ""Captain Marvel"" became the first MCU film to be fronted by a woman. Now, ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" marks the first Asian-led film. Not only does the film feature the first Asian protagonist, it also features a predominantly Asian cast and crew, which, thankfully, give this franchise a much needed change in perspective.

The Ten Rings have been around for nearly a thousand years, gifting their wearer, Wenwu, immortality so that he may rule with unmatched strength. After centuries of building an empire out of blood, Wenwu was turned away from a life of violence by Ying Li, a guardian of the mystical land of Ta Lo. When heartbreak struck shortly after, Wenwu picked up the rings once again, causing him to go down a dark path, and his son, Shang-Chi, to run away to the United States. Now after ten years, the son must come home to confront his father and become who he was truly meant to be.

Similar to what Ryan Coogler was able to do with ""Black Panther"", co-writer/director Destin Daniel Cretton brings out the best of this new world as he is able to handle the mountains of establishing exposition. His use of flashbacks may be a bit liberal, especially as the film reaches its climax, but they're used meaningfully to build upon a story focused on character and culture.

Without a leading acting credit to his name, Simu Liu takes the titular role by storm as he navigates this typical hero's journey with charm and composure. Mixing a bit of T'Challa with Tony Stark, Shang-Chi is a hero battling with his past and future. Liu and Cretton strike a great balance as Liu hands himself over to Cretton's material in the somber moments, and Cretton lets Liu's comedic instincts light up the room.

1322,1322,Thrilling & Funny,"This movie gave me hope that there are still bright days ahead for the MCU. Shang-Chi is very different from what we've seen in the past but it's so good. It's visually stunning and the action sequences are thrilling. It had the quality of action that I was expecting from Black Panther. The ten rings are fascinating to watch in use. There were such epic moments that I had to rewind and watch again a few times. I really wish I could have seen this is IMAX. It's one of the few movies that would have been a truly special experience.

With a story like this one, things could have very easily taken a downward turn into the realm of cheesiness and over the top. But it's all done so well. The comedy and serious moments are balanced really well. There are some real laugh out loud moments but the movie never feels silly. The back-flashes are interesting and meaningful.

One of my favorite surprises of this movie, is that it redeems the worst villain twist of the MCU. You know Marvel and Disney have done well when we look forward to seeing these new characters in the future.","This movie gave me hope that there are still bright days ahead for the MCU.

1326,1326,Chinese culture finally done right,"After the Mulan remake, it was safe to say that I was thoroughly disappointed, the portrayal of Chinese culture, even in the mystical sense, just felt like a disaster. But this one, oh this one was so much better. I was actually impressed. It felt like it was actually catered to a different market this time. While someone unfamiliar with Chinese culture may find it to be 'just another Marvel movie(albeit an amazing one), to those who know, you will be treated to something that has been basically non existent in Hollywood films, aka inside jokes/depth of knowledge that really helps elevate the film to a whole nother level.","After the Mulan remake, it was safe to say that I was thoroughly disappointed, the portrayal of Chinese culture, even in the mystical sense, just felt like a disaster.

1328,1328,It's a Kung-Fu movie,,
1329,1329,Great superhero entertainment with a classic storyline,"The charm of this movie comes from the setting of the main characters, showing a reflection of today's world, where Asian culture and the way of life in the west creates an environment of searching for one's own identity and place - this is where we meet Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) first. A young adult trying to navigate through his life far away from his family in the city of San Francisco. His partner in crime is his best female friend Katy (Awkwafina).

Simu Liu's character arc in this film is not significant. Although he makes a solid protagonist, his own character development is de minimis. Awkwafina, by contrast, steals the film as the ordinary person caught up in the epic power struggle. Her trademark zingers and bemused quips make her the perfect foil against the escapist superhero world that she- and we as the audience- are thrust into. Mandarin (Tony Leung Chiu-wai) is a subtly effective Marvel villain with a compelling family backstory; he is a cinematic antagonist with the most idealism and righteous sense of purpose since Bill the Butcher in ""Gangs of New York"".

Michelle Yeoh as Shang-Chi's aunt Jiang Nan has again some great fighting scenes which stand up to her wonderful performance in ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"". Overall this movie has great fighting scenes, extraordinary effects, especially the flying dragons which are delightful to watch. Highly recommended for everyone who likes superheroes and a touch of mysterious fairytales.","The charm of this movie comes from the setting of the main characters, showing a reflection of today's world, where Asian culture and the way of life in the west creates an environment of searching for one's own identity and place - this is where we meet Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) first.

1330,1330,Best thing in the MCU Phase 4 so far. At least you don't leave it full of disappointment that gets worse the more you think about it.,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is the first entry in MCU Phase 4 with a completely new superhero, an origin story, and is about Shang-Chi, son of a powerful man who has control of the ten rings as well as having an organization of the same name. Living a normal life, his world is turned upside down when the past he has left behind comes back to bite him. Not gonna lie, I wasn't hoping much from this movie considering how disappointing Phase 4 has been but to my surprise, this turned out to be the most entertaining entry in this Post-Infinity Saga so far, particularly because I didn't leave it filled with a layer of disappointment that gets worse the more you think about it.

It's not groundbreaking or different from what the MCU has given us before, especially when it comes to origin stories. In fact, it feels very reminiscent of the earlier movies that came in this cinematic universe following a lot of the same formula, part of the reason I enjoyed it as it reminded me of the good ole days where I was genuinely hyped about the MCU and getting introduced to all these superheroes without having any solid comic-book reading history. It's the usual Marvel schtick with a different skin but with good enough execution in certain parts that you get a steady flow of entertainment and hardly any major frustrations, if at all, from the entire 130 mins runtime.

What I enjoyed the most was the action sequences, which were predominantly hand-to-hand combat and weaponry based kung-fu. With good choreography and cinematography, fewer cuts, non-shaky cam, and the actors performing a lot of the combat themselves, it was thrilling. The accompanying soundtrack was nice too with a mix of modern and East Asian tracks that flowed well with the action.

The story itself, while ending up with the usual end-of-the-world trope that so many superhero flicks have, wasn't bad either. It was cool to see this side of the world in this cinematic universe and not having a typical Human baddie was nice as well.

However, the writing was still not particularly good as the movie sorely lacked urgency and stakes. There wasn't that OOOMPH that would have propelled this movie to higher tiers. It played safe and light with a lot of predictable elements so you just sorta experience the events which play out mostly how you'd expect. The dialogue could have been a lot better as well with the same story beats the movie employs and would have given characters a lot more depth where the emotional moments could have been hard-hitting. The titular character himself felt lacking in energy and charisma.

I did like the overall ensemble and how it all came together in the end even if full of cliches. I was worried about Awkwafina's character Katie and that she'll be annoying for the rest of the movie but I was pleasantly surprised by her relationship with Shang-Chi played by Simu Lu, it was sweet. I'm glad the humour wasn't in your face throughout and took a backseat at certain points as MCU lately has developed a habit of injecting way too much of their brand of humour and it hasn't worked for me. Not saying the comedy here was great as some of it fell flat on its face but some of it did work.

All in all, despite its problems, despite the movie playing it safe, despite it being predictable, I had fun. I do hope Simu Lu gives a stronger performance wherever his character shows up next because compared to other MCU heroes, Shang-Chi himself is among the lower end for me for now. If you like the MCU, then certainly give this a go. If nothing else, you'll probably enjoy the action. And if I were to rate it, I'd give it a 6.8/10.","Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is the first entry in MCU Phase 4 with a completely new superhero, an origin story, and is about Shang-Chi, son of a powerful man who has control of the ten rings as well as having an organization of the same name.

Black Widow was okay as a stand-alone picture and the same can be said by Shang-Chi. It is not a bad film.

Well done, I liked the kung-fu fightings, really cool and not forced or over exaggerated and most importantly, fluent and not much slowed down.

1340,1340,Not a previous phase movie,"I decided to write this review after watching Black Wodow, Eternals and Shang Chi. I understand the need to make a diversity movie, but all in all, aside from special effects, this movie can be easily replaced by almost any Chinese martial arts production with high budget. It's not a Marvel movie, it's a martial arts movie with Mystic elements.

It's actually good in its own way, but it certainly doesn't get that Marvel feel in all the previous movies. Neither do Eternals. Nor even the Black Widow, despite glorious Scarlett Johannson.

I really wanted to see more of the same as the endgame, and not to invent the formula from scratch.

It didn't feel like a marvel film, I'm not against diversity or going in different directions but it just wasn't a film I loved or would see again. The characters were bland and uninspiring, the humour was ok but bit same old same old and the plot which I'd guess you'd call the main theme felt a bit daft.

The cgi was awesome, graphics, choreography and costumes all really nice, parts were genuinely beautiful but if the film ain't doing much for me that doesn't matter.

Think a lot would hinge on whether you got this gimmick or liked it, I didn't, they were cool for set pieces and what they wanted to achieve in the movie but I just felt they weren't something I thought was interesting or that impressive.

It was always going one way, it was pretty predictable and I didn't feel or believe the emotion as I found the story a bit stupid, it just felt directionless and they were trying to do so much whilst achieving very little.

It felt long to, much longer than the run time, it just wasn't a film I'd recommend and it was one I felt disappointed.

I maybe backwards though as everyone's saying this makes up for black widow, I don't get that, I thought black widow was brilliant. Way better than this.

Also it seems if it's Asian and a bit funny everyone calls awkwafina.","It feels like a mash up of about 10 old movies anc 20 plots weaved into one film, for me I didn't enjoy it very much, there were positives but overall I didn't leave feeling like I'd seen something that special.

1349,1349,Kung Fu Romp with Lame Story,"Its your typical high flying kung fu action script layered on top of an uninteresting story with no depth.

The main character and his sidekick were tiring to watch because they are adults acting like teens. They never managed to become interesting. The acting however was fine so its not a knock on the actors themselves but the script was kiddie. They were clearly going for the teen demographic with this movie.

I personally couldnt enjoy it. Marvel in general, hasnt really produced a film that I enjoyed in a very long time so its not really surprising. This might be fun if you are younger but for adults who have seen or read a lot of stories, this is probably not good.","Its your typical high flying kung fu action script layered on top of an uninteresting story with no depth.

1354,1354,Precious ... ten times,"Of course I am just riffing off, teasing and making fun of certain things with my summary line. Though there is some truth in there too - especially if you consider the last third of the movie - quite fantastical, pun intended.

But there is so much more here. And while you may have seen the bus scene already (I imagine many times), it still is quite the highlight and works wonders! Because there is even more to it than the trailer/teaser revealed! As is with the plot and the characters of the movie.

I was able to watch it on an Imax screen and let me tell you ... wow! But also wow and much respect to Marvel and Feige and anyone involved that they dared to make the first ten minutes or so in chinese! And throwing a lot of chinese terms (slang?) in there as well - throughout! That gives it a touch of authenticity. How immigrants in America or anywhere else in the world grew up. I do the same with my Greek and German/English.

It is also nice and while I am prone to be sarcastic, I really think it's a good thing to have such a major and big representation - especially nowadays with Anti-Asian hate/crime rising. All because of people blaming China and people of China for a virus ... the movie does not have that as a topic, it is entertainment after all, but in every promo and interview that the actors were involved it was something that was mentioned. Good for them and good for us, that this was made.

I am a bit biased when it comes to the MCU and this did get a pure theatrical release, instead of the Black Widow treatment (which also was available on Disney plus and the cinemas at the same time). So there is not issue when it comes to that. And if you can watch it on the big screen - you will not be dissapointed! Now waiting for the other stuff to drop ... especially after the mid credit scene, that is such a tease ... the after the credits scene might also hint at something, but the bigger tease was midway through the credits (actually almost at the beginning of them to be honest).

Sit back and enhoy the movie and the really funny characters ... and quite a few familiar faces. Some from the MCU and previous entries but also some from Asian cinema!

1356,1356,Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,,
1357,1357,The best Marvel movie so far...,"Having seen the trailer for the 2021 Marvel action movie ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" I must admit that of course I was going to watch it, but I feared it would just be another run-of-the-mill-over-the-top-CGI-fest-but-barred-of-proper-contents Marvel movie. Yet, I opted to sit down and watch it, on the notion that it was a Marvel movie. But also because of the cast that starred in it.

And yeah, this movie was over the top in terms of CGI. Of course it was, because it is a Marvel movie after all. But luckily this movie broke the formula of the archetypical Marvel movie and this actually turned out to be the best Marvel movie so far. Well, at least in my opinion. Why? Well, because of the storyline and the fact that it mixed Asian culture and lore into the Marvel cinematic universe, and it was a much needed addition to an otherwise Western-focused series of movies.

The storyline told in ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"", as written by Dave Callaham, Destin Daniel Cretton and Andrew Lanham was certainly entertaining. And the movie didn't really have a dull moment, despite the fact that it was a movie that ran for 132 minutes. I thoroughly enjoyed the entire movie from beginning to end. And for me, this was a storyline with proper contents to it, that also included interesting characters and creatures.

Visually then ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" blew me away. The CGI team really worked their magic with this movie and brought it to life in a very visually fulfilling way. Lots of nice details and jaw-dropping special effects. And the creature designs in the movie were off the charts, I really enjoyed seeing those brought to life on the screen.

The character gallery in ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" was interesting, and that applies for both the villain and good guy side.

And they had such a great cast ensemble put together for ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"", with the likes of Asian cinema heavy weighters such as Tony Chiu-Wai Leung, Michelle Yeoh and Wah Yuen. But the movie was also nicely carried by Simu Liu, whom I was not familiar with prior to this movie. And also having Awkwafina in the movie was just brilliant, because she put on a spot on performance with her comedy sidekick character. And it was interesting and nice to see Ben Kingsley return to reprise his character of Trevor Slattery.

""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" is a good combination of action and narrative storytelling, which made for a very wholesome movie. And it should be said that the action sequences were breathtaking to behold, so very, very nicely choreographed and executed on the screen, taking that traditional Wuxia elements seen in Asian movies and mixing it in with the archetypical Marvel Western-based superhero movies.

I was more than genuinely entertained by ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" and it is certainly a movie that bolsters Marvel's hold for me, as their movies tend to be super flashy with spectacular effects, but rather hollow in terms of proper entertainment and storytelling.

My rating of ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" lands on a well-deserved nine out of ten stars. Director Destin Denial Cretton ensured that this 2021 movie takes the role of the single best Marvel movie to date for me.","Having seen the trailer for the 2021 Marvel action movie ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" I must admit that of course I was going to watch it, but I feared it would just be another run-of-the-mill-over-the-top-CGI-fest-but-barred-of-proper-contents Marvel movie.

1359,1359,Ten Years too Late,,
1360,1360,Indeed legendary,"It's been ten years since Shang-Chi(Liu, charming, stoic) last saw his father, and leader of the criminal empire The Ten Rings, Wenwu(Leung, charismatic enough that we feel a lot of empathy for him, even when he does terrible things that we desperately want him to stop doing). That was also when he last spent time with his sister, Xialing(Zhang, a badass who deserves more screen time. Honestly, I'd be very surprised if she didn't, in future projects). He's joined by his friend Katy(Awkwafina, quirky, providing a lot of comic relief, something I'm told she's in general adept at), for what can best be described as a tense reunion, which allows the movie to really mine the family melodrama, one of the best elements it has. I won't give away exactly what the antagonist intends to do, only that our hero has to stop him. However, he has to figure out how, maybe even if, that is even possible.

Not quite, yet almost ""Black Panther for Asian audiences"", this does a lot for representation(including for women. Some of the best characters in this are female. In addition to the two that I've already mentioned, there is also Ying Nan(Yeoh, wise)), it is positively drenched in Chinese culture(the third act, while in ways it feels like it belongs to a completely different film than the first two, takes an especially deep dive into that. Ultimately, it is presented through a Western lens, and clearly we need to go further in this direction, still, it is a big deal that they put so much of it in an estimated $150 to 200 million major blockbuster, which will be seen by millions of people who would never consider watching an art picture, especially one focusing on a group they don't belong to), to the point where countless times, when it makes sense, major characters in this speak Mandarin to each other, rather than English, which it is subtitled into. And ""don't worry"", for those who think that the following is important: there are white people on screen, and they aren't made out to be ""less than"".

The action(each sequence of which feels distinct, belongs with the rest, and is memorable) pays tribute to many different kinds of martial arts films, acknowledging that they are standing on the shoulders of giants. Jackie Chan, wuxia, etc. The choreography is matched in skill by the cinematography. Not only are we seeing incredible fighting, the camera is dynamic, celebrating and highlighting how incredible it is. That *is* why you hire Bill Pope, the director of photography on the Matrix trilogy, two of Sam Raimi's Spider-Man entries, Darkman and Team America. The special effects are excellent. There are some issues with pacing, and certainly a chunk of this is composed almost entirely of flashbacks.

This features relatively brief but highly concentrated, surprisingly graphic gore(you know, there was a time when the fact that it's happening to beings that clearly are not human, wasn't enough to get away with this kind of thing with a PG-13 rating. Pepperidge Farm remembers), as well as a little strong language. I recommend this to any fan of comic book movie adaptations, and people passionate about diversity hiring. 8/10.","It's been ten years since Shang-Chi(Liu, charming, stoic) last saw his father, and leader of the criminal empire The Ten Rings, Wenwu(Leung, charismatic enough that we feel a lot of empathy for him, even when he does terrible things that we desperately want him to stop doing).

It was that good in my humble opinion. Visually it was just stunning, great CGI's, very well choreographed fighting scenes, and a story that was most entertaining to watch. Some might find it over the top but it's a Marvel so what do you expect? To me this is one of Marvels best movies yet if not the best. The acting was good as well, and that from the whole cast. I never heard of Shang-Chi before but from now he has one more fan. Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings won't disappoint a lot of people, unless you're just not into this genre of movies. A must see for the fans.","Without spoiling anything as this story stands by itself there's going to be a sequel and I really look forward to that. It was that good in my humble opinion.

1365,1365,A Marvel for the whole family.,"""The US government was almost toppled by a pretender named after an orange."" Wenwu (Tony Leung)

This quote is typical of the light-hearted but also serious addition to the MCU that is Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings. Although Marvel has always been less serious than DC, this time it leaves Superman and Batman to cry in their capes. Sweet superhero Sean/Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) has more humanity than almost any other hero, and he uses his martial arts only when pressed.

The opening sequence on a bus (you can see the bad coming from other cinematic bus rides such as in Nobody) is rousing and entertaining. It has a fight sequence I laughed through because of its ballet-like composition but satisfying because it sets up character and motivation.

When things get heavy, and they do because Sean must confront and potentially kill his 1000-year-old mobster dad, Wenwu, Awkwafina's Katy, Sean's girlfriend, is there with amusing one-liners throughout the adventure, right down to a life-saving shot in the big ending battle scene.

Director Destin Daniel Cretton deftly orchestrates his fights and his characters' lines with the authority of a much more seasoned filmmaker. He never loses sight of the central motif-the affirmation of family primacy, so that the potential chaos of a giant cast and multiple plot strands hosts a unity glued by character and dialogue.

Shang-Chi is a Marvel for the whole family and especially the cinephiles curious how The Marvel Cinematic Universe can be so diverse, so entertaining, and so perfect a purveyor of our heroic fantasies.","""The US government was almost toppled by a pretender named after an orange.""

1367,1367,The legend of the ten Marvel movies a year for all eternity.,"'Shang-Chi And The Legend Of The Ten Rings (2021)' is, essentially, exactly what you expect it to be. Not only does it feel like a Marvel movie, it feels like a literal Disney movie as well. This is often detrimental to the overall affair, as the piece should have been much more unique than it ultimately is, and it makes for a much less interesting watch overall. However, the formula it follows has provided plenty of success in the past; this time is no exception. Its highs are where you'd expect them to be, as are its lows, and there is an undeniable sense of fun, albeit cookie-cutter fun, to be had. The film is an entertaining action adventure that follows a young man whose criminal father calls him and his sister back home in order to lay siege to the mystical village he believes is holding his wife, the protagonist's mother, hostage. The villain's motivation is a little underexplored yet entirely understandable. It comes from a believable emotional place and is more satisfying because of it. The relationship between the lead and his no-good dad isn't explored as much as it could be, though, and the flick generally has a bit of a theming issue. The piece tries to tie its events directly into the wants and needs of its lead characters, but it does so in an unsatisfyingly half-baked way and honestly would probably have been better if it played itself as more of a straightforward adventure ala most of the 'Mission: Impossible (1996-)' series. Still, the touches of character development are appreciated and each lead player is written to be as likeable as possible. This, combined with the amicable performances, means that you care about the heroes even though you don't have all that much reason to. This keeps you invested in their stories throughout. The highlight of the entire affair is, for sure, its action. For the most part, the picture stays towards the right end of the practical to CG spectrum. The fights are never exactly realistic, per se, but they're based on competent choreography and clean camerawork. They're, more often than not, really entertaining. Sadly, the flick inches closer and closer towards the wrong end of the aforementioned spectrum the longer it goes on. By the time it reaches its finale (which gives me major 'Fast And Furious Presents Hobbs And Shaw (2019)' vibes for some reason), it's clear that the balance it previously achieved is going to go out of the window. Sure enough, its climactic battle is an entirely computer-generated affair; it isn't all that compelling and goes directly against what made the movie so enjoyable to begin with. No matter how hard it tries to disguise it, it still ends with a big blue beam in the sky. Still, the finale isn't exactly bad. It's just annoyingly intangible and feels a little forced in, even (as do the rather cringe-worthy post-credits scenes). Ultimately, this is a generic yet entertaining experience. Its charming acting and exciting action are clearly its highlights, and its weakest aspects are still decent enough. It's a good movie. However, I can't deny that Marvel fatigue is becoming more and more pertinent in my mind. You know what you're going to get before you get it. Plus, the studio's insistence that it has to perforate every single outing with references to other, almost entirely irrelevant fare is really annoying. Although most of their movies are at least okay, I find myself not caring at all about them. That's sad, really, considering that the MCU has produced some genuinely great pictures in the past. 7/10.","'Shang-Chi And The Legend Of The Ten Rings (2021)' is, essentially, exactly what you expect it to be.

1368,1368,Fun martial arts action-comedy with some dragon ex machina,"After a flashback, this movie jumps to a couple of slackers, Shaun and Katy, with Shaun proving during a wild bus ride that he is much more than a car attendant. Soon they're on a globe hoping adventure with world-saving dimensions.

The martial arts choreography is terrific, from the opening forest fight through that fantastic bus bit to the final hand-to-hand battle (followed by the big special effects battle seemingly required in every Marvel film). Fights are funny and exciting and that final battle is truly suspenseful.

The cast is also excellent. Awkwafina is as funny as ever, Michelle Yeoh and Tony Leung bring all their seasoned expertise to their roles, and the actors are don't know are also first rate.

Although ... in the case of Simu Liu, who plays Shaun/Shang-Chi, I have no strong opinion. He's a pleasant every man who handles the action scenes well but seems less mythic hero than ""genial best friend of the main character."" With all the other talent on screen he doesn't manage to leave much of an impression, but on the bright side I don't object to him.

The story is fun, the movie does a good job of mixing humor, action, and tragical reminiscences the pace is terrific, and man there are some great fights. Recommended.","After a flashback, this movie jumps to a couple of slackers, Shaun and Katy, with Shaun proving during a wild bus ride that he is much more than a car attendant.

1369,1369,my eyes couldn't handle the sheer awesomeness on the screen,"Watch this in IMAX!!!! The entire movie has an expanded aspect ratio. You're watching about 70% of the image on normal screens, plus on way smaller screens with worse speakers. I promise, it's worth it

WOWOWOWOWOW. This movie blew me away. I love it. A LOT. From beginning to end. Everything. I walked out of the movie so hyped, silent-screaming under my mask as i walked to the car. It's been a while since i walked out of a movie this happy. I have so much to say.

I love the MCU (a lot), but there are a few things that are frequently lacking. One of them is good fight scenes. They always have awesome action scenes, but specifically fight scenes are usually pretty good, only great in a few movies like civil war and winter soldier. And in general, fight scenes in American movies pale in comparison to Asian cinema (Ip man, The Raid Redemption, anything Jackie Chan).

The fight scenes in this movie.... how do i describe it... amazing martial arts that's fast but clear, filmed in creative and astonishing ways without a hint of shaky cam or quick cuts, against stunningly beautiful backdrops... phenomenal. And they continuously focus on the fights instead of cutting to a different scene after 10 seconds like i've noticed in the MCU.

This is BY FAR the best fighting in the MCU and it's not even close. Has to be up there with the John Wick series and Netflix's Daredevil as some of the best we've seen in America lately. I loved the first major fight scene so much that i was worried it would be the best one of the movie, far too early. Lol. I be stupid sometimes

Another frequent flaw in the MCU is lack of compelling villain. Nope. Awesome awesome awesome. That's all i'll say.

Another of my frequent complaints is that the musical scores, with some exceptions, don't stand out. I think they heard. They're on a good streak with the shows and Black Widow. It's not as amazing as the Loki score but i liked it. It felt unique to this new franchise.

Still so much more to say, need to go faster. This is one of the best, maybe THE best, story in the MCU, especially the way it's told. I loved all the characters, i loved all the casting choices, i loved the performances. There are scenes of dialogue that gave me goosebumps. All the emotional moments hit. All the callbacks hit. There isn't anything that didn't work for me. There's no such thing as a perfect movie, but mannnnnn.

Lmao i didn't mention the cinematography. Why would i wait this long? It's MESMERIZING. A lot. Throughout. It's candy for your eyes.

It's also nice to see well-written comedy with jokes relevant to the scene and characters, that feels organic. As opposed to the ""insert joke here"" method we've been seeing more of, especially in Far From Home.

What's the opposite of formulaic? That's this movie. I never knew what to expect next (helps that i didn't watch a single trailer, they ruin movies). Definitely doesn't feel like a typical MCU movie. It has it's own unique tone and feel and character.

Continuing what i said in my headline, i have this thing where i get goosebumps and start tearing up, not from an emotional moment, but from a scene being so incredible, especially action scenes. Don't know why it happens, don't know if it happens to other ppl. Maybe it's partly because i can't risk blinking. That happened in this movie numerous times. Like ""this is the coolest thing i've ever seen in my life."" hyperbole, but mannnnn

after endgame finished phase 3 (yes i know spider-man), i was so happy and satisfied with the MCU. But i wasn't sure they could ever recapture that magic again. I knew i would watch everything and it would probably mostly be awesome. But i wasn't expecting top-tier stuff any more. Lol. I be stupid sometimes. I am ecstatic to have that notion obliterated. As of now, this is a top 6 MCU movie for me. Wow

All in all, i adore this movie. You may wonder why i wouldn't give it a 10 after all this raving. 10s are super rare for me, only 13 of them, and i watch thousands of movies. Interstellar, inception, mad max fury road, etc. Movies that shouldn't even be called movies. My 9s are rare too, they are my favorite movies. 10s are my favorites of my favorites. Only superhero movies i've given 10s are dark knight, dark knight rises and civil war.

If you're still reading, wow you're awesome! I think this is my longest review other than Interstellar.

I'm still in such a good mood. I can't wait to watch it again, in IMAX. I want to wait a week so it feels fresher, but i might not be able to!

I like how there's two people of the same gender who are not love interests.

We get some absolutely amazing fight scenes which seem right out of a classic Chinese martial arts movie. My only complaint is that it is a bit too long. It's still amazing with gorgeous designs of the creatures. It truly is a unique film to have a mostly all-Asian cast in a superhero movie. I recall an interview when the actor said a lot of Chinese people are called Bruce Lee.

1379,1379,Shang Empty,"Sorry for the delay.

Here we go...

I'm not feeling this movie. It starts with promise but It lost me after Wong vs Abomb.

The fighting is exciting. The movie lacks excitement though. It's a plain dull movie.

It's about a Karate master and... yeah the movie lost me and I have know idea what it's about. This is the first mcu film that I lost interest for midway. Even Im3 wasn't so bad because I lost interest from the very beginning.

Gotg2, mcu Spiderman 1/2 and IM3 are still the worse in mcu. Shang Chi just joined the club.

A movie so full of emptiness that it makes an empty box jealous

I'm not sure how this is a 7. Fans and the average movie goer should also be held responsible for horrible movies.

This movie ain't a 7 even if you watched this movie as blind and drunk.

They tried to be funny by having Wong be rude by drinking the couple's drink at the end credit scene. That wasn't funny at all. Wizard or not.

Speaking of funny, I didn't laugh once. When I used to watch these movies in theatres, the audience often told me when I should have laughed. I watched it at home, therefore I didn't know my cue of when to laugh.

The mcu needs to chill with the daddy issue plot

THOR Loki daddy issue Black Panta daddy issues Stark Daddy issues Star lord Daddy issues Ultron daddy issues Nebula and Gamora daddy issues Shang daddy issue Wasp daddy issues Scott langs daughter Daddy issues

1380,1380,Masterpiece...,"""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" is an Action - Fantasy movie in which we watch a new era of Marvel Studios rise with Shang-Chi, the master of Kung Fu. He has to face his past involving him with the Ten Rings organization and crate his future accordingly.

I have to admit that I had my doubts about this movie but I was proven very wrong since it's an amazing movie. It has a beautiful and very interesting plot that keeps you in tense through its whole duration consisted of plenty of action and nice CGIs. For one more time Marvel succeeded on creating a nice atmosphere and connecting the previous movies with this one with many Easter Eggs so, we expect more in the near future. The interpretation of Simu Liu who played as Shaun / Shang-Chi was simply outstanding and he made the difference. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Tony Chiu-Wai Leung's who played as Xu Wenwu, Michelle Yeoh's who played as Ying Nan, Meng'er Zhang's who played as Xialing and Awkwafina's who played as Katy. The comic relief role of Ben Kingsley as Trevor Slattery was a brilliant idea that also gave something different in the movie.

1384,1384,This movie is way better than it should be and is a worthwhile addition to the marvel universe,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (2021) is a movie my wife and I recently watched at the theatre. The storyline for this movie follows a young man and his best friend who work as parking attendants and are one day attacked by super villains. As they dig into the young man's past they discover his father is behind the attack with the purpose of hopefully brining his family back together. This movie is directed by Destin Daniel Cretton (Just Mercy) and stars Simu Liu (Blood and Water), Tony Chiu-Wai Leung (Infernal Affairs), Ben Kingsley (Iron Man 3), Michelle Yeoh (Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon) and Awkwafina (Crazy Rich Asians). The storyline for this movie is way better than it should be and has crazy depth around all of the characters. You really understand the what, when and why behind every circumstance and perspective. The acting is outstanding and the characters are perfectly portrayed. The special effects are awesome both in terms of the action scenes and backdrops. The dragons may have been a bit overdone; but other than that, A++++. The choreography was also excellent and seeing Yeoh in this really made me smile.

1386,1386,"Epic, stunning, and a strong powerhouse story.","5 out of 5 stars.

Shang-Chi and the legend of the Ten Rings is an awesome and exciting mcu film that brings the stunning world with the asian culture. I will say i enjoyed this more than the previous mcu film Black Widow. Shang Chi introduces a new mcu character played by Simu Liu. And Awkwafina which is also a fun addition. While they are being chased by an organization called ten rings. Lead by his father Tony Leung. While Shang Chi learns his abilities and the ten rings. Before his father is trying to use that power for a personal reason.

Great epic plot. Shang Chi and Katy (Awkwafina) enter a hidden world Ta Lao where there is magical mythical creatures. Is like a wow stunning moment when you first see Wakanda in Black Panther. The film does give an emotional story build up and a villain that can be relatable.

The cast ensemble is great. Simu Liu did great with the character along with Awkwafina as his friend. Meng'er Zhang, Michelle Yeoh, Benedict Wong, Florian Munteanu, and Tong Leung all did great.

The set designs and visual effects are stunning and great. Can be colorful at moments. The music score was good as well. The action sequences are great and exciting. Every set piece had an awesome martial arts choreography which was well shot with the cinematography. Director did a great job in capturing the action and fight sequences. Even with the epic climax of the dragon battle.

There are two mid and post credit scene which sets up for further films and has a fun nod to the mcu.

I will say Shang Chi is a great exciting addition and i found the film to be very fast moving. Action packed. And a great family conflict story that is emotionally driven.","5 out of 5 stars.

1387,1387,A Marvel-ous martial arts joy,"Showing no signs of slowing down hot off the heels of Black Widow, a raft of well-received Disney+ series and arriving not too far in front of the hotly anticipated The Eternals, Marvel continues to put in work that puts many other wheelhouses too shame, with the marital arts infused Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, yet another entry into the brands increasingly loaded catalogue of quality blockbuster releases.

It's hard to pinpoint exactly what Marvel keep doing to maintain the momentum that started all those years ago with 2008's Iron Man, it's absolutely correct when many say a lot of these origin stories and event pictures follow a very set formula from A to B, but with an ability to attract some of the best actors working in the industry today and handpicking a raft of some of the most exciting Hollywood filmmakers around, Marvel have once more struck gold with the incredibly fun and inventive Shang-Chi.

Quite possibly the most visually sumptuous Marvel film yet, sometimes feeling as if Marvel has meet with Ang Lee/Yimou Zhang and in my mind the Marvel film that features the best choregraphed action scenes yet from the spectacle heavy brand, Shang-Chi is a big screen blast that is freshly directed by the upcoming Destin Daniel Cretton who here has got his just rewards after his great debut Short Term 12 and the sadly undervalued The Glass Castle came before this big-budgeted ride.

Infusing his film with a great energy and charm that is enhanced by the work of leads Simu Liu (in a career launching turn) as our likable hero Shaun/Shang-Chi, Awkwafina (doing her usual but fun schtick) as Shaun's bestie Katy and Tony Leung as the unfortunate villain of the piece Xu Wenwu, Cretton has turned out to be the perfect choice to start off the cinematic journey of the fist swinging Shang-Chi and helps instill in his film some nice differences to what we've come to expect from comic book blockbusters of the modern era.

Most notably for the film is the exciting use of hand to hand combat that is delivered spectacularly in two stand out sequences on board a moving bus and then bettered alongside a high rise building in Macau, both these set pieces are easily some of the most noteworthy of any Marvel film yet while also benefiting the film other than its Asian infused eccentricities is the fun relationship between Shang-Chi and Katy than never bothers with adding extra baggage to add weight to their believable and fun friendship.

If there was a major drawback to Shang-Chi's many wins it is in an overdrawn finale, a major problem many have acknowledged previously when it comes to Marvel films, Cretton and his team can't quite stick the landing for Shang-Chi with it being a little too long in the tooth for its own good and slightly overblown and while it features some incredible imagery and technical wizardry, the films rip-roaring start and strong middle section gives way too something lesser.

Final Say -

Another huge win for Marvel who have here with the help of director Destin Daniel Cretton and his talented cast, created an instantly likable cinematic universe that provides the comic kings with one of their most unique and exciting playgrounds yet.

1388,1388,Not bad,"The opening fight scene is worth the watch, but the cameos steal the show. I won't go in to detail. The Marvel geeks will know what I mean, because there are plenty to count even the hidden ones.

The movie is good and I like the casting. The direction is okay but the cinematography is the best.

The ending is anti climatic. I found it to be cliche. However it is worth the watch. It is nice to see a movie like this and I believe it is a good addition to your watch list.","The opening fight scene is worth the watch, but the cameos steal the show. I won't go in to detail.

1389,1389,Yet another superb stand-alone superhero flick in MCEU's kitty.,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (2021) : Brief Review -

Yet another superb stand-alone superhero flick in MCEU's kitty. MCEU's new phase never looked so promising but their products are delivering Better than expected. That Spider Man flick in 2019, right after Endgame, changed many perceptions about Marvel's future and even though couple of their recent series like 'Wanda Vision' and 'Loki' couldn't emerge as clear winners, they have set a solid base for upcoming new stories. Shang-Chi is a new start by all means. Not only because it comes under new phase but mainly because it is a stand-alone film and with a new superhero who is more like using traditional combat methods along with ancient superpowers. When Captain America or Black Panther begun as Stand-alone films, they promised too much and thankfully fulfilled it. Shang-Chi does the same. It may not promise too much like Steve Rogers and Wakanda stories but the point where it ends surely gives us hints of new assembled version of superheroes in Multiverse. Shang-Chi, the master of unarmed weaponry-based Kung Fu, is forced to confront his past after being drawn into the Ten Rings organization. The film has major portion covered by Family values and hence, it may look predictable but does not bore at all. Yes, few scenes are outdated and too dramatic as if we are watching a Superhero Film made in 90s but let's just forget those weak points as Shang Chi has excelled in Visual spectacle. The screenplay could have been better in the second half when the big War was supposed to take place but it actually looks tiny one except for those two humongous dragons which might remind you of 'The Hobbit'. Performances by Simu Li, Awkwafina, Meng'er Zhang, Fala Chen, Florian Munteanu are fine according to less potential available for the roles. Actually, the humour and tone of these characters was great. They all looked normal people when they were not fighting and even though the film has ancient refrences, the character don't actually go too deep to become expressive. Director Destin Daniel Cretton seemed slightly off track in the beginning when he tries to humanise all the characters with that typically teenage humor but as the film goes ahead, he recovers from the childish entanglement. With super explosive climax he surely makes up for his mistakes, rather makes us forgive it. Overall, Shang Chi is another superb entertainer for Marvel Fanboys and even neutrals are gonna enjoy it.

RATING - 7/10*

1390,1390,This could've been great if it wasn't for the cheesy writing.,"The story was riddled with holes and plot issues. Since when does Awkwafina's pedestrian character all of a sudden get invited to become part of the MCU team? What's her super power... stupidity? Don't get me wrong, I love her, but her character was lazily written. Then there's the whole daddy issues dynamic - Shang is with him, then against, then with etc.. Then we have these ridiculous dragons fighting, where one scores some power crystals and becomes stronger! This is just infantile lazy writing. There was zero shock value or anything spectacular in the entire runtime, with tedious long middle acts and a bumbling third act. The jokes were cliched and not funny. The funniest parts were Ben Kingsley's character, (of whom was in this for what reasons??) and the ending to go Karaoke - which was the only time I actually cracked a chuckle. You'd think with three writers we'd have something cohesive and coherent. But instead of a Marvel superhero story, we got a Disney evil vs good with dragons thrown into the mix. It's as if they tried too hard to create the Asian version of Black Panther.

It's a shame, because the directing and cinematography were spot on, and great S/VFX - although a little overboard with the CGI i.e. Dragons. The martial arts choreography was outstanding (although again, overboard after the awesome bus scene), and the casting and performances were excellent, especially Leung, who pretty much carried the film on his shoulders. It's a 7/10 from me.","The story was riddled with holes and plot issues. Since when does Awkwafina's pedestrian character all of a sudden get invited to become part of the MCU team?

1391,1391,8 Rings out of 10,"For the first time in a couple of years, since 2019's ""Captain Marvel"" the MCU introduces us to a brand new hero. Simu Liu who, rather impressively, first asked for the role on Twitter brings us Shang-Chi in a film that perhaps does have some issues with it's ending, but ultimately is a fun, funny ride of the type Marvel have been perfecting for the last 13 years.

Talented, but somewhat aimless, Shaun (Simu Liu) lives in San Francisco working as a valet with his friend Katy (Awkwafina). When he's attacked on a bus, he's forced back into the world of his father, a ruthless terrorist Xu Wenwu (Tony Chiu-Wai Leung). First visiting his sister, then returning to the Ten Rings compound, Shang-Chi decides to use his skills to defend his late mothers sacred homeland against invasion from his father and for control of ten mystical arm rings, weapons that grant their owner immortality and unearthly power.

If ""Black Widow"" was considered a wobble for the MCU, despite the fact I thought that it's a perfectly fine film, then it was important to come back with something that was undeniably excellent. ""Shang-Chi"" was that. It's the perfect balance of humour and action that Marvel have established over the last few years. The action too is tweaked slightly, to more closely resemble the types of Asian led action films that we've seen previously, be that the Jackie Chan style bus fight, or the ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon""-esque flashback fight between Shang Chi's parents. There's some lovely links to the wider MCU, including a return for Benedict Wong's Wong and for Trevor Slattery, Ben Kingsley's ""Iron Man 3"" character whose masquerading role as The Mandarin was one of the MCU's most divisive moments.

It's not perfect. The ending is perhaps a little rushed and lacking a moment or two of redemption earning for Xu Wenwu, but the peaks at the future for the character, and for the 10 Rings organisation is an interesting addition, plus our first real step on what might be the route to the next big bad. Excellent stuff.","For the first time in a couple of years, since 2019's ""Captain Marvel"" the MCU introduces us to a brand new hero.

Much fighting ensues but fortunately everyone eventually learns how to 'get along' when faced with a real threat. You have seen it all before: physics-defying martial arts, monsters who look like the recently swallowed strings of LED Christmas lights, conflicted heroes with wise-cracking 'comic relief' sidekicks (an awful Aquafina and an even more awful Ben Kingsley), giant melees featuring a variety of glowing weapons (but no blood), hyper-kinetic and hyper-implausible car/motorcycle chases, and a lot of clichéd wisecracks, tough-guy dialogue, poseur slo-mo, and heroic vogueing (we're treated to the venerable three-point power landing/slide a number of times). The only novel thing the film has to offer is the excellent rendering of mythological beasts from Chinese culture; otherwise, it's an overly-long (132 minutes, which is 120 minutes too much Aquafina), derivative, repetitive, and ultimately boring entry in the bloated, jejune Micky Mouse-Marvel superhero franchise.","Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) discovers that his all-powerful and millennium-old father is about to launch an attack against the magical village where Shang-Chi's mother was born in the likely mistaken belief that his wife is not dead but is rather being held captive (there is more to the plot than one sentence can sum up but what does it matter... the story is just scaffolding for the special effects).

1395,1395,Promises good things for MCU's Phase Four,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings stars Simu Liu in the lead role alongside such heavy names as Tony Leung and Michelle Yeoh in this latest installment to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Liu's Shang-Chi must come to his own as the son of the legendary Mandarin (Leung), the owner of the Ten Rings.

I like this film's style most of all. Director Destin Daniel Cretton mixes Chinese wuxia settings and aesthetics with Hong Kong wire kung fu inspired action set pieces, while still keeping it feeling like a Marvel film. There's a surprising amount of callbacks and nods to the larger Marvel universe, pleasing dedicated fans, but the film is still able to stand on its own feet and introduce us to its hero.

Kudos also to the whole filming for these action scenes. Very little shaky cam or jump cuts, especially for the hand to hand scenes. Exactly as it should be. I'd dare to say that this film has some of, if not the best action set pieces in all of MCU.

One of the most thrilling and visually spectacular end battles as well, come to think of it.

Furthermore, the acting is solid, especially from Liu, Leung and Awkwafina, who plays Shang-Chi's American friend. Meng'er Zhang as Xialing, Shang-Chi's younger sister, was perhaps my only real gripe with the film. I could have used either a bit more edge to her or alternatively a lot less. Now she seemed to flipflop between relatable and aggravating.

All in all, not the best Marvel movie by any means, but that's a really high bar to clear. I can simply say that based on this, I'm very optimistic about MCU's continued future.","Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings stars Simu Liu in the lead role alongside such heavy names as Tony Leung and Michelle Yeoh in this latest installment to the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

There's a surprising amount of callbacks and nods to the larger Marvel universe, pleasing dedicated fans, but the film is still able to stand on its own feet and introduce us to its hero.

Kudos also to the whole filming for these action scenes. Very little shaky cam or jump cuts, especially for the hand to hand scenes. Exactly as it should be. I'd dare to say that this film has some of, if not the best action set pieces in all of MCU.

One of the most thrilling and visually spectacular end battles as well, come to think of it.

Furthermore, the acting is solid, especially from Liu, Leung and Awkwafina, who plays Shang-Chi's American friend. Meng'er Zhang as Xialing, Shang-Chi's younger sister, was perhaps my only real gripe with the film. I could have used either a bit more edge to her or alternatively a lot less. Now she seemed to flipflop between relatable and aggravating.

All in all, not the best Marvel movie by any means, but that's a really high bar to clear. I can simply say that based on this, I'm very optimistic about MCU's continued future."
1396,1396,The Master of kung fu was really good but not as good as I wanted it to be.,"It was better than the proceeding Marvel movie Black Window. More exceeding the expectations of a Marvel movie. Shang-Chi feels like the marvel movie experience is starting to get back to the normal of the theme ride Martian Scorsese believes they are (I can't disagree, just note that's what I want)

In comparison Shang-Chi is a lower level character. I am a fan of Marvel comics but got more of the references to the Marvel Cinematic Universe in this movie than to the direct comic book references. Those Marvel cinematic universe references were amazing enough to get over the fact that the obvious comic book ones went over my head. I mean this movie's connection to other movies is great fanfare that makes me love it more. So really cool cameos happen that actually move the story along.

I did like what they did with the Mandarin here but do feel they copied and paste a lot of things into the story of Shang-Chi to make a complete movie for a lower level character. From the little I know of the character he more fits into those Netflix's shows they did a few years back but change him enough to justify a blockbuster.

They did succeed in making Shang-Chi's background more fuller. The relationship between him and his father and sister was beautiful, complex and more importantly, never bored me and of course Awkafina as the comedy relief and best friend to Shang-Chi was strategic gold. The story for the background was not that full. It's really a character driven movie for without the amazing performances from a group of actors who know their stuff this story would fall short.

Note, I loved the fact that Michelle Yeoh was in this movie and that gives it a lot, but she's done way better in less effective films (but she most likely got a huge paycheck from Disney just to wave her hands around).

The special effects were good in this flick. I was impress with what was used to make the final conflict and I was convince that the dude from Kim's Convenience was a master of kung fu

Its a good movie but it did not live up to my high expectations of it. It gave me a lot of cool things but really did not give me anything I did not see before, in movies that did it better, but if it's about anything I did spend the rest of the day pretending I knew Kung fu.","It was better than the proceeding Marvel movie Black Window.

1398,1398,Finally a new kind of marvel story,,
1399,1399,An easy watch that fits into the MCU well,"A San Francisco valet finds his past catching up with him in spectacular fashion.

This is an entertaining superhero adventure story with an Asian martial arts theme and a number of entertaining scenes.

Like many introductions to superhero characters there is a bit of backstory to go through and this film does it with flashback sequences in a similar way to 'Black Panther'. These are mixed with the action, humour and unfolding narrative of the present day plot. Additionally there is some important exposition added relating to the Marvel multiverse. Personally I think everything depicted could have been done in more than one movie, and not so rushed, but that's just a personal preference. What is presented is not complicated in anyway, but very simplified, presumably so that it can be established quickly and the likes of Shang-Chi and Katy can share screens with other MCU characters as soon as possible.

The tone and general feel of the movie also reminds me of the approach taken with 'Black Panther', particularly when it focusses on a location that, like Wakanda, mixes the sights and sounds of regional culture with the sci-fi fantasy. It has obviously been written carefully so that it displays imagery associated with far-Eastern culture like martial arts, traditional costuming, rural settings, that is marketable to a Western audience, but at the same time it avoids other commonly associated negative stereotyping like exaggerated accents, sorcery, yellow peril, bad driving, and (thankfully) gong sounds. Much of this is drenched with a liberal amount of fast-talking contemporary American humour.

There are a number of highly enjoyable scenes such as the fight sequence on the bus, the various comedy moments, virtually everything that comes out of Ben Kingsley's mouth, and all the flashback scenes. The final dinner table scene is probably my favourite.

Visually as you can imagine it is beautiful and full of top drawer cinematography, editing, and technology-driven effects. For me though the spectacle goes over-the-top, particularly in the final action sequence.

Most actors are solid such as Simu Liu, Tony Leung, Meng'er Zhang, Michelle Yeoh, Fala Chen, and Benedict Wong. The standout performances for me easily are Nora Lum and Ben Kingsley who have buckets of charisma and the advantage of all the best lines.

Overall there is little to criticise, it just feels like what Martin Scorsese described perfectly in 2019 as a theme park rather than cinema.","A San Francisco valet finds his past catching up with him in spectacular fashion.

Continuing to expand its cultural horizon the MCU's first Asian-centric movie has unique choreography, a dazzling visual scheme, splendid hand-to-hand combat, and of course the expected teases going forward, but some of the more elaborate action set pieces lack needed tension, much of the exposition and backstory isn't very engaging, and up until the third act many of the emotional aspects of the narrative aren't as rich or compelling as they could be.

1405,1405,Marvel Sprinkles a Different Flavor into the MCU,"Marvel gets mystical in this mashup of the plucky, familiar MCU character and the more stoic, legend-heavy air of wuxia films. It's a fresh mix, effectively breaking the gravity of its more serious moments with a well-timed jape while lending credence and lore to a lesser-known corner of the comic kingdom, but these crossover moments sometimes test their limits. I could see more grounded viewers being turned off by the dragons and soul-sucking demons (far cry from the feasible reality of the first Iron Man, that) while serious fans of Chinese fantasy are bucked by the constant injection of loose wit and slappy one-liners.

When it's rolling, Shang Chi does manage to toe that line and deliver something appropriately new and versatile, a good reflection of both worlds. It benefits from a tight pair of central performances (Simu Liu and Awkwafina as a team of underachieving twenty-somethings) and several big, powerful action sets (the articulated bus fight might be one of the best combat scenes Marvel's ever put out) while tying in a dangling thread or two from earlier films to provide a sense of greater connection. On several occasions, however, it's guilty of being too self-indulgent and losing the narrative. It's great to see Ben Kingsley again, adding nuance to his part in Iron Man 3, but his scenes are the main offender here; excessive and distracting and way too cute.

The action is strong, the dialogue (mostly) works, the scenery looks great, but in the big picture, Shang Chi feels small-scale and disposable. Non-completionists won't miss anything crucial if they choose to skip it.","Marvel gets mystical in this mashup of the plucky, familiar MCU character and the more stoic, legend-heavy air of wuxia films.

1408,1408,Marvel movie by the numbers with beautiful dragons and charming locations,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is yet another movie inspired by the Marvel universe that has constantly been inspiring the cinematic world for more than a decade now. While the movie follows the usual stereotypes, it manages to stand out with its stunning special effects and locations.

The movie revolves around Shaun, a Chinese immigrant living in the United States of America who is working as a valet with his quirky friend and soulmate Katy. One day, they get attacked by a group of assassins on a bus and only just manage to survive. Shaun immediately understands that the attack must be related to his influential estranged father. Along with Katy, he decides to team up with his tough estranged sister Xialing to find out what's going on.

This film convinces on multiple levels. First of all, the acting performances are quite quirky and convincing. Especially the ladies steal the show. Awkwafina delivers the goods as curious, dynamic and funny woman that anyone would like to have as a friend. Zhang Meng'er on the other side represents a much darker character shaped by dramatic events from the past who is much more difficult to approach with her tough, relentless and independent personality.

The expensive special effects certainly deliver the goods as well. The scenes in a fantasy world, in Ancient China and in contemporary San Francisco are all equally stunning to watch. The fantastic creatures such as dragons look impressive on the big screen.

The story might be predictable but is nevertheless entertaining from start to finish thanks to steady pace and inspired execution. You will truly care about the fates of the different characters as you are watching this film.

However, this film isn't without its occasional flaws. First of all, lead actor Simu Liu simply doesn't have the charisma of the other actresses and actors involved. Casting him was a bold choice but it didn't fully pay off in my opinion.

Up next, the movie desperately tries to connect to other characters in the Marvel Universe. The appearance of Trevor Slattery played by Ben Kingsley is completely random as it only seems to be a pretext to offer some misplaced comic relief. The mid-credit scene starts in an amusing fashion but suddenly involving Bruce Banner and Carol Danvers only seems like a weak attempt to develop a hype for potential sequels. The same goes for yet another scene after the credits that evokes more questions rather than concluding the film appropriately.

At the end of the day, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is an entertaining fantasy action film of the Marvel Universe that should appeal to faithful and occasional fans alike. It's one of the better films in the franchise but perhaps Marvel should focus on quality over quantity instead of becoming a monstrous capitalistic machine that is scarier than any gigantic dragon shown in the film.","Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is yet another movie inspired by the Marvel universe that has constantly been inspiring the cinematic world for more than a decade now.

1412,1412,"A fun time at the movies, and that's all it really needed to be","Charming and incredibly fun- Shang-Chi may not be the best Marvel has had to offer- but it is one of their better films in some time. My main problems with the film lie in the films storyline, which to be honest, is really good, but incredibly all over the place editing wise and there is just so much of it that it feels like two movies could have been made out of it. I love that we get a more in depth look at our characters, their flaws, their regrets, the tragedy in their lives- but the editing makes it feel rather out of place at times- and takes away from the impact the film could have had and its heart. That being said, the film still manages to be very enjoyable throughout. The action scenes are absolutely incredible, the look of the film incredibly well developed- something very fresh and original for Marvel studios- and the cast are all a joy to watch- especially Simu Liu and Aquafina in the lead and supporting roles. I was skeptical of Aquafina being in a Marvel movie for sure, but she really helped the film as a whole, and honestly I would love to see more of her character in future Marvel projects. The film is entertaining, despite the pacing of the film being a bit all over the place at times. It has some brilliant, elaborate special effects that you will be gawking at on the screen, and plenty of surprises that will be bound to make you smile. In the end, Shang-Chi was a fun time for a Marvel movie- something most comic-book flicks have forgotten about recently- and i'm excited what this character has to offer in future films.

1413,1413,Shang-Chi and NOT the Ten Rings -_-,"As someone that really enjoys the MCU, I'm starting to wonder if COVID may have killed it. Black Widow was a meh experience and now Shang-Chi feels like more of that rote, by the numbers repetitiveness. Yes, they add a lot of Asian elements here to bring in other groups and try and lessen the white dominance of this franchise and I appreciate that but this movie felt like it was rushing through the plot to get to the next fantastical element and in so doing really robbed those moments of any lingering significance. Not to mention, the Marvel formula felt so very pronounced. It's so obvious what's going to happen in this movie from the jump and that's disappointing.

That aside, I'm a moderate fan of older Marvel comics and... THESE AREN'T THE TEN RINGS! Normally I don't mind when the MCU makes little adjustments to the source material. Comics are weird and a lot of that stuff wouldn't translate well to film, I get that but so far they've had two big, fat whiffs on anything Mandarin related. Looking at you Iron Man 3. These things are just super generic bands with pretty underwhelming powers which is so different from the 10 rings in the comics that all do something different!

Nerd rage aside, this just felt average to me. I'll probably check it out at some point again but I'm not feeling any sort of draw to revisit it soon. It's a touch more disappointing as I work through the Disney+ Marvel shows which all feel more engaging and more creative than this. Come on, Mouse. Get it together and put some of this TV magic back on the big screen!","As someone that really enjoys the MCU, I'm starting to wonder if COVID may have killed it.

Simu Liu gives an incredible and extremely charismatic lead performance whilst also having superb chemistry with Awkwafina, who is also incredible. Michelle Yeoh and Meng'er Zhang are both great and Tony Leung is amazing as one of the better villains in the MCU with plenty of backstory and depth.

Destin Daniel Cretton's direction is excellent, it's extremely well filmed and stylish with some of the best action sequences in the franchise. The fight choreography is extremely impressive and the CG is mostly strong. It's well paced and both the soundtrack and the music by Joel P. West are both fantastic.","Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is an incredible MCU origin story that's epic, emotional and extremely thrilling whilst also connecting to the greater universe in fun and satisfying ways.

Great Pacing: Shang Chi has a lot of things built into the tale as it tries to make an origin story fit so far into the movie series. With all the information, there might be worry of the pace being off, but surprisingly it is done super well. Never really dragging, but not moving a blinding pace (mostly), Shang Chi's combination tales keeps things moving but not flying over the important elements to connect with characters. The cast gets ample time to give us their backstories, piece together all the cluse of this dynamic drama puzzle, and not sacrifice on the action to come.

Character Development: The trailers may have you thinking this is a modern martial arts film, and in a sense they would be right. However, the movie takes it one step further and goes beyond the punches to instead give the characters some soul and layers compared to the legendary films of the past. Shang's life is complicated and torn between light and dark, his sister as well experiencing the drama in her own manner that parallels the main protagonist. Even the antagonist has layers far beyond what we normally get from the Marvel group, and I loved how well their lines mixed together to make this melodramatic family story fit naturally into the Marvel universe.

The Surprise Cameo: Can't say much without spoiling, but if you are like me, then you will not be disappointed who shows up in the film. Several questions are answered with this character's return and with it many laughs to be had in the manner very familiar to Marvel fans. The inclusion of this character also holds an important (albeit stretch) plot element to give a little more meaning behind it, and I loved the choices they made to include him in the big picture.

The Cultural Influence: Like Black Panther and the African Culture, Shang Chi integrates so much of the cultural values of the Asian provinces into this movie. The costumes are stunning takes on the traditional attire, bringing the past to light while also sewing in some modern styles to jazz up the outfits. Concepts of family honor, the customs to practicing Marshal Arts, and the honoring of family are well-integrated into the story and help give the predictable tale some extra Kung Fu kick. The architecture of most of the setting breathes new life to the typical cityscapes that have been made famous in Marvel, and the legends of the Ten rings scream of the Asian mythology that is seeped int heir history. I loved how well these things were merged into a Marvel tale, and though again a little predictable and flaunting, really elevated the origin story to stand out from so many others.

The CGI Finally Disney has invested in making their movies show off what the studio can do. Shan Chi and the bunch have plenty of amazing things to overuse the computer effects that the modern era loves. Special effects for the action scenes has more realism to it then Black Widow executed, the creatures you will see have a lot more polish and fluidity to their movements, and the special effects involving the ten rings are fluid and holding depth that I felt has been missing in some recent Marvel projects.

The Acting: A great part played by all members on this film, extras included, Shang Chi's cast shows that acting is not dead and characters can be utilized well. Simu Liu as the lead was fantastic, and his campaign for being in this movie could not have ended up with better results. He holds much of the prodigal martial artist, disciplined and focused to be an avid fighter capable of crushing his enemies with his style. However, he also has that troubled layer in the past to watch that helped spread his emotional spectrum. Awkwafina is still the same cooky role she always plays, but this time gets a little more balance and heroism compared to the other characters she has heralded as in the past. I loved how well she was used in this film, and how great she complemented Simu in this role. Leung brings a lot of pizazz to the character, once again giving us an antagonist with so much more than the scowl and fist, and I felt was a perfect casting to play the opponent of Shang Chi. So many other great actors and actresses in this film, but due to time restrictions I have to move on, but trust me they did well in their performances.

The Comedy: Awkwafina is often used too much for making us laugh, and Disney has struggled with forcing a lot of comedy to make it kid friendly. However, Shang Chi has taken some steps back into discipline and used the comedy well to break up the ice. Dialogue goes a long way to breaking in the laughs, with well-timed jokes and gags being the solid punch to the gut with comedy. There are several ridiculous inclusions in this film that at first seem out of place, but then roll back in to be an extravagant joke that had great set up. And the throw in references that come with it and you get a shining beacon of awesomeness that comes with this movie. It's all done so well and I was very happy with the results.

The Action: My bread and butter for most of the Marvel movies, Shang Chi delivered very well on this film's action exposé. The art of choreographed battles brings another homage to Asian culture, and with it fantastic fights that had more bite and impressive skill use then half of the Marvel cinema. It's exciting, it's dynamic, and most of the fights have a different feel to them than what you might expect. Used well in the story, there is purpose behind the inclusion of the battles and each one has a different meaning and stakes behind it than simply punching and kicking. Even more so, the strategies behind them and what is required to win, accomplishes a level of storytelling that has been lost in the modern era, so well done on that too.

A Bit More Adult: The movie is definitely showing Marvel's modernization into the 21st century, and takes a risk of making this film darker and more adult than other installments. Cursing is definitely increased in this one, with plenty of swear words filling the dialogue, but not to the point of being overdone. No F bombs, but some of the language has got a little more bite, so caution. In addition, the tone of the tale is darker, and the sunshine and rainbows of Thor, Captain America, and Guardians is left in the dust for a grittier tale, which again is a plus.

Some of the political moments: While nowhere as bad as 75% of movies today, Shang Chi does sometimes get a bit preachy with the agenda politics of the film. Taking time out to rub it in our faces with an obvious line stating, ""Look what I had to do,"" was a bit of showboating that I could have done without. Yet even this dislike is marginal, given it's very little occurring, has some nice moments that build off of it, and sometimes has a fun lesson or joke built in.

A Little More Action:

The action in this movie is great, and I loved how much of it flowed and accomplished what I was expecting of the film, and things I was not expecting. Yet there were times where a moment of fighting felt a little forced, namely the chase scenes with vehicles that seemed like an afterthought. However, the fights at the end needed some more time for me, and perhaps a little more bouncing between the battles occurring at the same time. Star Wars has done this successfully in the past, showing all manners of battling and giving you a big scope of the battle. Shang Chi has done this better than several of the Marvel films, but still had some room to give us more looks at the other characters kicking butt. The battle is lengthy enough, I'll agree to that, but a little more showing off of the other warriors would have rounded this fight to perfection for me.

The VERDICT:

Shang Chi finally made me feel like we were back into the realm of Marvel I fell in love with years ago. A cultural building world with both origin and story continuation, this hero's quest had all the makings of a fun, exciting and swift adventure we were expecting. Buried beneath the amazing fights and special effects, was a deeper movie than I had expected, using their characters well and integrating them to serve a purpose. Balanced comedy with a cultural inclusion and politics did not steal away from the main theme of the movie, and giving it that adult touch was a plus in my book, though again caution with your little ones watching it. As for limitations, I agree there is predictability and familiarity with the movie, but the fresh twist and balance helps rejuvenate the formula and add minimize the impact of the limitations for me. Though I will say a little better wider scope battle is still needed by them. Overall, my scores for this film are:

Action/Adventure/Fantasy: 9.0-9.5 Movie Overall: 8.5-9.0.","Likes

1418,1418,Most Mystical and Beautiful Movie In History!,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is the most mystical and beautiful movie in history! The music, the special effects and the acting all take you to another world. The film leaves you wanting a Morris of your own.

The storyline follows a young man named Shang-Chi (Simu Liu). His father is a one thousand-year-old man and conqueror nicknamed The Mandarin (Tony Leung Chiu-wai), who has only ever used the infamous and all-powerful Ten Rings for evil. When the Mandarin is set to unleash infinite evil on the universe, Shang-Chi has to stop his father.

This movie is a cinematic experience. The fighting and choreography are out of this world. The long slow motion shots make the audience feel as if they are in a video game. Simu steals the show; every fight scene is flawless with his fluid movements and it proves just how hard he worked on his character for this film. Every audience falls in love with Shang-Chi; he's funny, with perfect comedic timing and he knows the balance between peace and violence. He encapsulates what the majority of young adults feel - like not being able to find their place in the world. The movie makes fans feel as if they've known Shang for years. It has wonderful flashbacks, which give the audience glimpses of his past, his pain and how his fears have shaped who he is. The film gives a wonderful all-around scope of this character that feels like a friend we've known all our life. It makes fans excited to see Shang-Chi again. Shang and his sister Xu Xialing are an iconic duo. They're both powerful and, while there's some tension due to their past, they put everything aside and let love shine through. Xialing is a role model, officially joining the Marvel Cinematic Universe's most powerful women. Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is perfect for AAPI (Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders) representation in cinema. It represents Chinese culture powerfully, shows what it's like to be an Asian-American in modern day USA, not to mention that Simu is Marvel Studios' first Asian-American superhero. Simu and Shang-Chi are writing history while also inspiring children and fans all around the world. The film delivers on all grounds; the cameos are shocking and leave you on the edge of your seat. Trying not to shout during the two post credits scenes prove to be a challenge. By the end of the movie, I wanted to sing the song ""Hotel California"" at the top of my lungs.

This film reminds you to search for who you are and let your past guide you to who you want to be. Ever since his mother died, Shang has been trained by his father to use violence. When he arrives at his mother's village, he learns how to find peace within himself and the world around him. He learns to trust himself and to use the rings for good.

I give Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 10 to 18 plus adults. It is available only in theaters September 3, 2021.

1421,1421,"More movies like this, please, Marvel","Thought I was feeling some Marvel fatigue after WandaVision (which started strong but ended on a bit of a whimper) and Black Widow (which wasn't terrible, but two months later I can't remember anything about it except how Florence Pugh was cool in it), but this one has rejuvenated some of my enthusiasm for the unstoppably huge MCU.

There's a satisfying origin story here, with a few small appearances from familiar characters that add spice to a host of new characters who are all quite compelling right out of the gate.

The action's great, and there's also so much of it- I liked how lots of the action felt relatively grounded by MCU standards, with neat stunt work and exciting camerawork making the action pop (it's only the final battle that gets really CGI heavy).

The humour's also more consistent than most Marvel films, with most of the jokes landing. Also cool were all the fantasy elements and creatures- they were all pretty inventive and well-executed.

I will say the one notable flaw is that there's a lot of exposition in the film's second half, but they get around that a little by having great actors like Tony Leung and Michelle Yeoh do most of the explaining (and there is a lot to explain, with this being a whole new side of the MCU and all), so it's not super noticeable.","Thought I was feeling some Marvel fatigue after WandaVision (which started strong but ended on a bit of a whimper) and Black Widow (which wasn't terrible, but two months later I can't remember anything about it except how Florence Pugh was cool in it), but this one has rejuvenated some of my enthusiasm for the unstoppably huge MCU.

I've read the criticism that the storytelling was choppy, but I didn't find it so. For me it was more like chapters in a book, completely working together to create a world of content and design.

1425,1425,"Could be better, still enjoyable","As a MCU fanatic, I've been trying to get excited about the movies they have released post-Endgame, but it has been a challenge. That particular film was such a perfect finale for the series that I have struggled with the efforts to get the storyline going again. It doesn't help that they have been so scattered in topics, lacking a single core group to bring them all together. Shang-Chi is another random hero that I only knew vaguely from references in the comics, but I never read any of his books back when I was a collector. I appreciated that this film brought a new style to a MCU movie. The blending of Wuxia into a superhero story was a fun choice.

There were also quite a few great actors in this film including Tony Leung, Ben Kingsley, Michelle Yeoh, and I'd even include Awkwafina in that category. I can certainly see how some other people might struggle with Awkwafina's schtick, but I find her comedic timing to be great, and I was laughing along the whole time. However, the one major name I left out of the ""great actors"" is Simu Liu. Sadly, I found him a little bland. He was okay with the comedy, but I certainly don't see him stacking up with the legends that have come before in the MCU. Heck, Benedict Wong has only about 5 minutes of screentime in this film, but still made a greater impression on me than Simu Liu.

Digging into the story of Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, I'd say it's a fine origin story, even if it was highly predictable. This is the kind of movie where you can stay 10 steps ahead of it, and that is unfortunate. I think that's the biggest problem with the entire film, while it's fun and engaging it also feels like a rough carbon copy of things that came before. It's a movie that is emulating a number of Wuxia films from the past, but it's not as good as any of them. It's a movie that is following the tropes of a superhero origin story, and once again isn't on the level of the best of the genre. You can't fault their ambition, but their execution was lacking.

All that negativity is not to say that Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is a bad film. In fact, I enjoyed the entire time in the theater, and was genuinely invested in the story. I thought it handled the links to the MCU well, but without feeling like it had shameless pandering for the fans, or devolving into obscure references only people like myself would understand. The film had some gorgeous visuals, and created its own world in a way that managed to be both unique but still consistent with the style of other MCU movies. There were personal stakes in the film, despite the fact that the ending fell into a giant CGI battle that felt unnecessary. I can't say that Shang-Chi will rise into the upper echelon of my MCU rankings, but it's better than some that came before.","As a MCU fanatic, I've been trying to get excited about the movies they have released post-Endgame, but it has been a challenge. That particular film was such a perfect finale for the series that I have struggled with the efforts to get the storyline going again. It doesn't help that they have been so scattered in topics, lacking a single core group to bring them all together.

Sean (Shang-Chi) lives in San Francisco and parks cars for a living with his best friend Katy, whom he met when they were 14. He's happy with his life. He enjoys karaoke.

One day these bad, scary looking guys attack Sean and Katy on a bus and demand the green pendant Sean wears around his neck,,,

Oh yeah,,, Sean's real name is Shang-Chi, and his father is the leader of the TEN RINGS terrorist organization. What?!?!?!?!?!?

The visuals are incredible, and Awkwafina is hilarious!

1427,1427,Marvel's answer to Shonen Jump.,"Shang Chi is Marvel's latest blockbuster to grace the movies: and after 2020's non-existent Marvel slate, it was about bloody time we got something after the world dealt with the sars-variant and got our double shots. And now, late 2021 we can finally go back to the movies en masse, though the road to recovery's far from over.

Shang Chi is part-origin-story for a character we've never known before, part-CG-spectacle interlaced with nice kung-fu choreography in between, all in-universe expansion for Marvel's cinematic ambitions. And it makes you wonder how deeply they thought about paying reverence to everything from Bruce Lee to the Matrix, to Dragon Ball, The Last Airbender and Kung Fu Panda.

Marvel is doing its best to escape the confines of Iron Man's legacy, and this seems like an earnest start for something far-removed from the likes of Spider-Man, and so on. Also makes you wonder if Awkwafina is gonna become a major player outside the Shang Chi movies alone.

Shang Chi is the stuff you've come to expect from Marvel Studios; it's going big and it won't stop with every subsequent film here onward. Though bigger and better seems better fitted for high-concept space operas like Infinity War and Endgame than more earthbound character-driven stories.

Shang Chi's good fun, and it really succeeds in being that during its runtime.","Shang Chi is Marvel's latest blockbuster to grace the movies: and after 2020's non-existent Marvel slate, it was about bloody time we got something after the world dealt with the sars-variant and got our double shots.

1428,1428,Shang Chi,"Review By Kamal K

Marvels new Shang-Chi was a choreographed dance movie disguised as Kung fu with slow paced action scenes and subtle but detailed components that pull a story together a satisfying but inappropriately fast paced manner. Making the writing seem more lazy and poorly thought out, which for me took away greatly from that satisfaction.

The main gripe I have with Shang Chi is how it just so happens that the Jade neckaces show the path and time to the hidden forest path just days before another oath opens for them to go find the tao lao.

Although the comedy music, and some of the choreography for the fight scenes were good enough to give this movie a final score of 6 out of 10 score.","Review By Kamal K

1429,1429,Entertaining but still not 'old' MCU level,"I have to admit I've been pretty disappointed with every MCU movie since Endgame so I was pleasantly surprised by Shang-Chi, which I didn't really have high hopes for (the last Marvel martial arts based hero was Iron Fist, and that was a turd). This movie was very entertaining even if it had a pretty generic and predictable storyline, and special effects were fairly uneven (amazing 'MCU quality' along with pretty terrible early 2000s CGI). It's great to add more diversity with an Asian superhero but I hope they will make good use of him in future movies and not relegate him to secondary sidekick roles!","I have to admit I've been pretty disappointed with every MCU movie since Endgame so I was pleasantly surprised by Shang-Chi, which I didn't really have high hopes for (the last Marvel martial arts based hero was Iron Fist, and that was a turd).

1433,1433,A standalone ret-con of previous MCU mistakes.,"With the end of the Infinity Saga in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, there is a lot of room for new franchises to fill in the gaps left by the likes of Iron Man and Captain America. However, this means lesser-known properties like Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (2021) get their chance to shine. And while lesser-known franchises like Guardians of the Galaxy are now household names, I think it remains to be seen if Shang-Chi can truly develop its own integrated identity within the MCU.

Having somewhat botched the introduction of the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) in Iron Man 3 (2013), Shang-Chi attempts to ret-con this by insisting that the Ten Rings organization is a genuine threat to world peace. However, Marvel wants to have its cake and eat it too by including the ""Mandarin"" in this film. There are a few other loose connections to the larger MCU in this film, but they are more cameo call-outs than anything significant. Overall, Shang-Chi is its own story.

The fact that a good portion of this film's climax takes place in a mythical hidden kingdom made it feel disconnected from the MCU as a whole. Sure, other franchises within the MCU have their origin stories. Still, I felt they made it clear how they contributed to the ""whole"" of the larger arc by either introducing characters or concepts in prior MCU movies. Shang-Chi excels in its action and choreography but feels generic in the grand scheme of things as a standalone film. I'd almost wager that its sequel will be much more interesting and that those not already committed to the MCU can probably give this one a pass.

1434,1434,See Shang-Chi on the Big Screen,"The new Marvel Super Hero film, SHANG-CHI and the LEGEND OF THE TEN RINGS is the kind of film that deserves to be seen on the big screen and Writer/Director Destin Daniel Cretton (JUST MERCY) has crafted a film that earns that statement.

Based on the Marvel comic book character (of course), SHANG-CHI tells the tale of...well...Shang-Chi a financially struggling - but happy - Valet in San Francisco who has a family secret.

Writer/Director Cretton has crafted a whimsical, mythological, mystical and action packed film that settles in at the top end of the Marvel Cinematic Universe family of films.

At the center, newcomer Simu Liu (KIM'S CONVENIENCE) more than holds his own as the newest Super Hero in the MCU. He is grounded, centered and more sure than unsure as he discovers his abilities and his family's secrets. He is a worthy addition to this world of Superheroes.

Joining him is the remarkable Awkwafina (CRAZY, RICH ASIANS) as his best friend, sidekick who handles the drama comedy and action with aplomb. This film makes some smart choices with this character and Awkwafina shines.

The rest of the cast/characters are equally as strong from Tony Chi-Wai Leung (as Shang-Chi's father) to Meng'er Zhang (as Shang-Chi's sister) and good ol' Michelle Yeoh (as Shang-Chi's Aunt) bring strong characters to life. They all shine.

This film also brings back a character from a previous MCU film that somewhat redeems the poorly conceived character from his earlier appearance. I won't spoil it by saying who it is, but I liked what the MCU did with this character.

But, this being a Marvel movie, all of these performances anchor a bigger picture that is filled with action, action and more action - and something else, something mystical.

Here is where Director Cretton really shines. The action scenes are interestingly staged and choreographed well. The first fight (the bus fight that is shown in the trailer) and a fight on scaffolding both particularly work well.

This film does delve into the mystical in the last 1/3 and in Cretton's hands, this ends up working well instead of being comical or inane. I bought what was going on and was rooting for our heroes to defeat the undefeatable, fantastical creatures.

To be honest, the ""final battle"" didn't really live up to the rest of the film so that brings this film down a notch, but this movie did what it needed it to do, it opened up a whole new area of the Marvel Cinematic Universe - in both character and locations - and I am anxious to see where they go from here.

Try to see SHANG-CHI on the Big Screen, the visuals are worth it.

1442,1442,Ten Rings to rule them all...,"Positives:
This is Marvel at its best. A script (with Shakespearean undertones) that melds action with good character development and laugh-out-loud feelgood dialogue. The great thing is that you don't need to be a Marvel nerd to enjoy this one. Yes, there are some fabulous Easter Eggs for Marvel fans (and a wonderful return of a character from one of the early films). But its almost a standalone feature in its own right.


The action sequences are top-notch, particularly an early fight on a careering an Francisco ""bendy-bus"". Some great martial arts reminiscent of ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", made more exciting by the fact that the impressive Simu Liu did all his own stunts.






Negatives:






Timeline?: So, it took more of a Marvel nerd than I am (my wonderful daughter-in-law Bronwyn) to point out that although this film is set (largely) in the ""Present Day"", the events of ""Avengers: Endgame"" actually happen in 2023. So in the Marvel timeline, this is set in between Thanos's ""blip"" and ""the return"". This is the reason why Wong is present but not Doctor Strange, for example.

Summary Thoughts: Marvel goes East! This is a really entertaining addition to the franchise, mixing Marvel action with Eastern mysticism and martial arts. It's an impressive job by director and co-writer Destin Daniel Cretton, in only his second feature (he did ""Just Mercy"" in 2019).

As a Marvel film, there are of course end-credit scenes (""monkeys"" in onemannsmovies speak). A mid-title one is the best, bringing some additional Marvel characters into the mix. And there's a post-credits one which sets up for further sequels but which I found rather irritating.

It's ironic that a Marvel movie so right for the Chinese market - the first to be headlined by an Asian actor and with substantial Mandarin dialogue - might not get a release in China. According to this report, this appears to be for two reasons: firstly that the actor Simu Liu made some derogatory remarks about China in the past, and secondly that in the comics Shang Chi's father is Fu Manchu - a Western-derived character with racial overtones.

This doesn't seem to have hurt it so far. After less than two weeks of opening, it has made $262 million on a budget estimated to be $150-200 million.

This is Marvel at its best. A script (with Shakespearean undertones) that melds action with good character development and laugh-out-loud feelgood dialogue. The great thing is that you don't need to be a Marvel nerd to enjoy this one. Yes, there are some fabulous Easter Eggs for Marvel fans (and a wonderful return of a character from one of the early films). But its almost a standalone feature in its own right.


The action sequences are top-notch, particularly an early fight on a careering an Francisco ""bendy-bus"". Some great martial arts reminiscent of ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", made more exciting by the fact that the impressive Simu Liu did all his own stunts.






Negatives:

1446,1446,One of the most Emotionally Charged Superhero Movies made in recent times.,"Let's keep aside all these serious conversations about Asian Representation, Diversity and all other societal stuff for a moment and let us all just appreciate Marvel for creating one of the most (if not the Most) emotionally charged superhero movies in recent times.

I'm not even exaggerating, I have been a follower of Marvel since my teenage days, suffice it to say, Through many ups and downs I keenly witnessed all of their works over the years. Trust me when I say that they have very much revamped their strategy this time around.

Excluding their typical set-up for a Comicbook blockbuster, Shang-Chi's familial/dramatic aspects are on an all-time high here. The way this story has been told, it just feels somewhat distinctive and special (Especially, compared to the last few projects Marvel has had come up with).

Other than the apparent masteries in its Audio-Visual departments (as expected); the narrative here infuses a powerful statement, a different outlook on family & self-acceptance. And guess what? It never sounded preachy nor pretentious; not for a single moment.

Another praiseworthy characteristic is the Action sequences or to be precise, all the Choreography behind! An incredible show for the Martial Arts fans and yeah FYI Simu Liu (Shang-Chi); our primary protagonist did most of his stunts, all by himself; that is amazing Isn't it?

Pretty much the same impression applies to all the other members of the ensemble; however, I do have some serious reservations about their respective character depictions.

To start with, Shang-Chi's estranged father (Played by a veteran, Tony Leung Chiu-wai); The writing on his character felt a bit detached and incoherent! Don't know about you, but for the most part, I was rather uncertain about what should I exactly feel about this guy! Should I be sympathetic or furious about the choices he had made? Gotta say this dilemma got the better of me.

Furthermore, the Mother of Shang-Chi (Played by Fala Chen) from Ta-Lo; I do feel her screentime in here should have been elongated a little bit more! Just so the viewers could grasp her part of the storyline too! Other than that, she, herself was pretty great in there. No complaints whatsoever. And Oh yeah, Nora Lum or Awkwafina (The Name, majority of you might know her by). She was terrific in her role as well; the much-needed comic relief in such a sob story!

In a nutshell, I must admit, this was a rather unprecedented gamble from Marvel and It did pay off quite well in the end. To be honest, I couldn't be more pleased about that! As I see it, these Superhero films tend to get repetitious over the years so it's always like a breath of fresh air whenever there is a drastic transition coming straight from the creators, and when it gets backed up by the Big Studios themselves; well that's your cherry on top.","Let's keep aside all these serious conversations about Asian Representation, Diversity and all other societal stuff for a moment and let us all just appreciate Marvel for creating one of the most (if not the Most) emotionally charged superhero movies in recent times.

1447,1447,What a pleasant surprise this was!,"Visually a perfect film for me watching a film in theatre after 20 months. Going in I expected marvel to half-ass the genre but still make it entertaining like a number of their other films. But I was taken aback wonderfully right from the beginning with the opening narration completely in Chinese. What I saw then was a proper modern wuxia fantasy which with some changes could've fooled me for a Chinese production (maybe I'm being a bit hyperbolic).

As fitting to a wuxia film, the lust for power, the love that conquers evil and the despair of lost love are all seen in this film. And who best to bring all those than the legendary Tony Leung who was the face of Hong Kong cinema through In The Mood For Love and acted in some of the best Wuxia films. He was definitely the best thing about the film. I was half expecting Marvel to mess it up like they use great actors for villains all the time. But he was the first main character to appear and even till the end his presence was felt.

This also has some of the best hand to hand action sequences in the MCU easily. The martial arts action, even when the superpowers are included also makes the action just beautiful which is something I feel the first time in an MCU film.

Awkwafina was quirky but what I liked there was that they kept it platonic and didn't jump into anything at any point. Maybe they'd do that in the future but at least they didn't break the flow in the relationship. Meng'er Zhang and Fala Chen also made their presence felt, as badass fighters. And Michelle Yeoh as expected of her came in and owned the screen when she was present.

I'm really surprised at how much I liked the film. The final fight sequences that rose to the most epic Chinese fantasy fight you can think of is the only thing I was expecting them to not mess up. Maybe it is because of my low expectations on how Marvel deals with the genre and the villain that made me love this so much.","Visually a perfect film for me watching a film in theatre after 20 months.

1448,1448,A Very Fresh MCU Entry,"When Iron Man hit theatres back in 2008, there were rumblings about a cinematic universe starting, but obviously, nobody expected that we would make it to a film like Avengers: Endgame at the time. Along the way, unknown properties like Guardians of the Galaxy and Ant-Man came out of nowhere as well but were welcomed with open arms. I was really hoping that Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings would follow in those footsteps, and it more than does. With rich world-building, a great cast, and the use of mythology, this is one of my favourite Marvel Cinematic Universe entries to date. Over time I may even come to appreciate it even more. After a first viewing, here's why Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings deserves to be seen on the big screen (if you can).

After being trained as an assassin by his father, Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) is given ten years of freedom from this life. In the present, the film picks up with Shang-Chi (Shaun) as he is living a normal life in San Francisco with his friend Katy (Awkwafina). When the history/mythology of the so-called Ten Rings is brought back into the forefront, his mission is to go and find his father. With the help of his friend and sister, they return home to face the music and it may just end up being father vs son to save this world. From start to finish, this film delves into the fun, the mythological, the family drama, and some incredible martial arts in order to tell this very solid story.

Aside from the fact that newcomer Simu Liu is undeniably charming and very likeable in this role, it's the unique style of the movie that made it stand out from the rest of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Yes, it still has the same look and feel, especially when it comes to aesthetics and comedic relief, but the rest of the film had its own distinct heartbeat. Bringing martial arts into this franchise just felt like a breath of fresh air to me. Not only does it feel simultaneous that they're trying to have fun and pay homage to classic films of this nature, but the fact that martial arts, mixed with actual god-like powers just felt so earned by the climax of the film. Without giving anything away, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is far more magical and mystical than I was expecting, but I kind of loved the finale when looking back on it.

There's really not much about this film that I feel compelled to complain about, but I will say that with as much drama that this film has and with how much it does dive into mythology, sometimes the comedy felt out of place. Awkwafina as Katy was great and I think her chemistry with Simu Liu was great as well, but I think certain cuts to her one-liners felt a little unnecessary for the specific situation. There are a few scenes where moments deserve our full attention, but the film felt the need to cut away to something funnier. Aside from the humour taking me out a few times, this film is just a blast.

Overall, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Tens Rings is easily at the top of the origin films that this franchise has given us and probably one of my favourite entries as a whole. Director Destin Daniel Cretton (Short Term 12, Just Mercy) has done a great job here and the cinematography by Bill Pope (The Matrix, Baby Driver) was also a real standout. I thought the scope of the movie felt very grand and that's absolutely in part to how it was filmed. I almost thought the finale of the movie was going to be a huge negative, but again, after thinking about the movie again, there is a nice progression in the story that makes the climax feel earned, even if a tad overblown. If you're a fan of this franchise, this one is a must-see, but even if you're not, this one can stand on its own as well, having only a few acknowledgements to previous films.

Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is now playing exclusively in theatres and if you're able to go in your area, I highly recommend it.","When Iron Man hit theatres back in 2008, there were rumblings about a cinematic universe starting, but obviously, nobody expected that we would make it to a film like Avengers: Endgame at the time.

1449,1449,Good,"One of the best origin MCU films. Good story, great and complex family relationships, with it's own identity, a very good balance between action and comedy and really good fight scenes. Between Simu Liu, Awkwafina and Tony Leung it's difficult to decide which was the best, but the acting was really strong all around (also a mention to Ben Kingsley, always funny!). The best thing I can say about it is that for most of it's duration it didn't even feel like an MCU film.

The negatives? Again, too much CGI. It's a huge problem with Marvel and Disney as they use the green screen in almost every scene. I like CGI but seriously, some scenes would look much better with practical effects, others would look way better if they just were shot at location.","One of the best origin MCU films.

1454,1454,A miss in the MCU.,"Hollywood trying to be too woke about being Chinese.

Always hate it when they make a villain not really a villain as to not offend anyone. Shang Chi's father is supposed to be a pure villain, the mother storyline took away a lot from the real storyline.

Awkwafina's character becoming a boss archer after one day of training was equally ridiculous.

Hopefully if a sequel is made it will be darker, though I'll admit the Mandarin was a funny touch.","Hollywood trying to be too woke about being Chinese.

1455,1455,A Great Origin Film,"The next instalment of the MCU, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings has come out and I managed to see it the other day and I have finally found time to review it and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees a young martial artist forced to face his past when his criminal father comes hunting for him.

Main Character Relative unknown Simu Liu plays Shang-Chi and he is really good in this role. He really delivers a strong performance and you will come out of the film really liking him and caring about the character of Shang-Chi. The focus on his family dynamic is really well done and Liu does a great job in selling that and showing the pain that he has been through in his life and bringing this great hero to life. He is also fantastic in the action scenes and that is a huge part of this film and you have to believe in the heroes capabilities and I really did.

Supporting Characters Awkwafina plays his best friend Katy and I feel like this character is really going to split opinion, some will hate her, some will love her. I pretty much hit both ends of the spectrum, I thought she was really annoying in the first act of the film and it hurt my enjoyment, but as she had her role slightly lessened she became much more likeable and her character arc became very clear. Tony Leung plays his first role in an American film playing Wenwu and this is one of the best antagonists in the current MCU. I loved this character and performance, he isn't just some generic bad guy and at times I really understood his motivations and saw the emotion from his performance and it was really strong. Meng'er Zhang plays Xialing and I liked her character here and I thought it really complemented Shang-Chi really well. There is clearly issues there and the film plays it up well, and makes her more then just this female sidekick and she is given a personality.

Story The story is at its strongest when it focuses on the family issues between the characters, in particular Shang-Chi and Wenwu. That father and son dynamic is great and both actors deliver really well in their roles and it makes there clashes feel even more important as you genuinely care about both of them in the film. The issue is that the film kind of strays away from that and tries to focus on too much. It has plenty of exposition scenes and fits so much in that it distracts from the main thing that makes this film great. The final act puts the focus in the wrong place, its hard to explain without spoilers but I think you will know what I mean if you watch the film.

Script The script is okay, the drama is really well done and made me care about these characters and the emotional predicaments that they are put in during this adventure and I actually think this film is held back a little bit by the fact that it is in the MCU. What I mean by that is that it has the humour you come to expect from the universe is here but it is done poorly and I never really laughed at all and that was a disappointment.

Style The film looks fantastic, the CGI is all beautiful and I think it does an excellent job of building this world of Martial arts that is very different to other elements of the MCU. The fight scenes live up to the hype and are the best that have been seen in The Marvel Cinematic Universe, the flow so well and are so hard hitting that it is easily the best element of the film.

Overall Overall, Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings is a great film and another solid addition to The Marvel Cinematic Universe. It isn't top tier Marvel but does a great job of introducing a new hero in Shang-Chi.

Rating - 8/10.","The next instalment of the MCU, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings has come out and I managed to see it the other day and I have finally found time to review it and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees a young martial artist forced to face his past when his criminal father comes hunting for him.

Main Character Relative unknown Simu Liu plays Shang-Chi and he is really good in this role. He really delivers a strong performance and you will come out of the film really liking him and caring about the character of Shang-Chi. The focus on his family dynamic is really well done and Liu does a great job in selling that and showing the pain that he has been through in his life and bringing this great hero to life. He is also fantastic in the action scenes and that is a huge part of this film and you have to believe in the heroes capabilities and I really did.

Supporting Characters Awkwafina plays his best friend Katy and I feel like this character is really going to split opinion, some will hate her, some will love her. I pretty much hit both ends of the spectrum, I thought she was really annoying in the first act of the film and it hurt my enjoyment, but as she had her role slightly lessened she became much more likeable and her character arc became very clear. Tony Leung plays his first role in an American film playing Wenwu and this is one of the best antagonists in the current MCU. I loved this character and performance, he isn't just some generic bad guy and at times I really understood his motivations and saw the emotion from his performance and it was really strong. Meng'er Zhang plays Xialing and I liked her character here and I thought it really complemented Shang-Chi really well. There is clearly issues there and the film plays it up well, and makes her more then just this female sidekick and she is given a personality.

Story The story is at its strongest when it focuses on the family issues between the characters, in particular Shang-Chi and Wenwu. That father and son dynamic is great and both actors deliver really well in their roles and it makes there clashes feel even more important as you genuinely care about both of them in the film. The issue is that the film kind of strays away from that and tries to focus on too much. It has plenty of exposition scenes and fits so much in that it distracts from the main thing that makes this film great. The final act puts the focus in the wrong place, its hard to explain without spoilers but I think you will know what I mean if you watch the film.

1456,1456,A wonderful addition to the MCU!,"Shang-Chi is one of those Marvel films that feels like the full package. It has lots of brilliant trademark MCU humour and tongue in cheek quips. It has exceptional action which I'll get into a bit more. It also has solid connections to the rest of the MCU, balanced well between being its own stand alone film but laying hints of how this is going to fit into the wider story of Phase 4.

I'll start with the action as this is what Shang-Chi is famed for. Quite simply it's awesome. It has the best hand to hand combat the MCU has seen, and sequences that are steeped in Chinese culture, with the rhythmic style of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon woven into the fabric of this film.

The cast was brilliant. Simu Liu was a fantastic lead, and I'd be happy to see him grow into a big player in the MCU. Awkwafina as expected was fantastic, adding so much effortless humour to the film.

What I really love about Shang-Chi is that it has a very well explored and interesting antagonist. This can't always be said for Marvel films as there have been a few phoned in villains, but Shang-Chi doesn't come close to falling into this trap. Tony Leung really sold his role and gave it a lot of power and emotion.

In terms of plot they did a fantastic job of introducing us to this pretty obscure character. There is a lot of exposition and plenty of flashbacks, perhaps too many but I appreciate they had a lot of background content to feed us so I can't grumble too much. I loved how the plot was so mystical and magical, very much feeling like an epic adventure.

Yet again Marvel Studios knocking it out of the park!","Shang-Chi is one of those Marvel films that feels like the full package.

1457,1457,nothing out of this world but a lot better then i expected,,
1458,1458,Showcases the possibilities of Phase 4,"This was the right direction for Marvel to head post-Endgame. Finding new stories to tell within cultures rarely explored is the way for the MCU to continue to entertain.

The fights in the first third of this movie were absolutely brutal and quite innovative. I wish they hadn't front-loaded all of this stunning choreography since the fights later on paled in comparison. This film also contains arguably the most beautiful and artful scene in the MCU with the Crouching Tiger-inspired hidden garden duel. There was a sense of more indie-based filmmaking and I really enjoyed that fresh take on the genre. I would be remiss not to mention Tony Leung, who perfectly brings to life one of the finest villains in the MCU. His character has a lot of depth and is one you can truly empathize with.

While there are still the tropes expected in a Marvel origin film, it succeeds pretty well for the most part. I wish the big CGI battle at the end had just been a personal fight between father and son, but alas. The humor, especially Awkwafina, was pretty hit or miss as well. The Trevor Slattery stuff was great though.

Shang-Chi is definitely one of the best origin films in the MCU and really stands out as a unique entry in the long-running series.","This was the right direction for Marvel to head post-Endgame.

1459,1459,Really good blend of martial arts and MCU formula,"The bus fight scene is one of the best action scenes of the entire MCU. Just for that scene alone, this movie deserves to be watched on the biggest screen possible. Shang Chi benefited from being a very unknown character and the movie gives him the opportunity to shine bright with his development. The story is really fast paced and even if the final act succumbs to the typical Marvel esque, it leaves you with a pretty solid good feeling while leaving the cinema. A really great MCU movie, a superb martial arts spectacle and a great step up for the Phase 4. Do not miss the two post credits scenes. The middle scene is exciting and the very last one is pretty intriguing. Bring it on, Marvel!","The bus fight scene is one of the best action scenes of the entire MCU.

1460,1460,The birth of a new legend,"The birth of a new Marvel Hero. And a very successful one. One of the better Marvel adaptations of the recent years and the perfect introduction of this new hero.

Its packed with amazing action, a great legacy and a wisely picked cast who get the chance to portray fun characters.

To start with Simu Liu who shoots himself to stardom with this film. His portrayal was fun as he perfectly mixes the hero attitude with a nice tongue-in-cheek humor and perfectly develops himself without taking all of it too seriously. Same goes to his co-star Awkwafina who was perfectly cast. Having Tony Leung as the to center-part was an excellent creative decision. Then the film has some fan favorites appearing as Ben Kingsley's Trevor or Benedict Wong who round it up to a wonderful Marvel adventure, just as you would expect.

The action scenes are tremendous, as the film is filled with great Martial Arts sequences, (of course Michelle Yeoh is not to be missed here). The bus scene at the beginning is a true stand out action scene in the entire Marvel universe.

Really a good one for the next phase of Marvel, and I like how it links to the whole universe just perfectly. Another Marvel winner.","The birth of a new Marvel Hero. And a very successful one. One of the better Marvel adaptations of the recent years and the perfect introduction of this new hero.

1461,1461,Elevates itself above the typical superhero origin story by incorporating many fantastic elements from Asian culture,"""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" is the second film in Phase Four of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Starring Simu Liu, Tony Leung, and Awkwafina, it elevates itself above the typical superhero origin story by incorporating many fantastic elements from Asian culture.

In San Francisco, Shaun (Simu Liu) works as a parking valet along with his close friend Katy (Awkwafina). Unbeknownst to Katy, Shaun is hiding important secrets from her - he is in fact a skilled martial artist whose real name is Shang-Chi and he has run away from his father Xu Wenwu (Tony Leung), the leader of the powerful Ten Rings organisation. After some Ten Rings members attack the pair of them on a bus, Shang-Chi discovers that they have stolen a valuable pendant given to him by his mother Li (Fala Chen) before he left for the United States. Shang-Chi grows concerned that the Ten Rings' next target will be the pendant belonging to his younger sister Xialing (Meng'er Zhang), and so along with Katy he sets off to look for her before the gang can locate her first.

Now that the Infinity Saga has concluded, the time has come for some new heroes to enter the MCU. Of course, there are so many to choose from, considering the large roster of characters that have come into existence over the last several decades. Although Shang-Chi wasn't the first one to come to my mind when predicting who would lead the charge of fresh faces into Phase Four, his debut big screen outing ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" successfully cements him as a memorable hero just as worthy as any other past Avenger.

What I believe separates this film from the typical hero origin story is all of the interesting aspects of Asian culture it integrates into the story. I'm all for inclusivity in movies, so long as it isn't shoehorned in there for the sake of appeasing a political agenda, and here it succeeds greatly thanks to the wide array of Asian crew members who worked hard to ensure that virtually all customs are represented. The film never precisely establishes the place Shang-Chi's family is from (though it is hinted to be somewhere in mainland China), as they are seen observing various cultural traditions that don't quite narrow things down to one particular Asian country. For example, there are martial artists resembling Shaolin monks, who are supposed to be from China, seen using techniques from Japanese and Korean folklore. This has likely been done on purpose to ensure that all Asian audiences feel included, but never so much that it comes across as disrespectful. After previously bungling Asian-related matters with the terrible 2020 remake of ""Mulan"", ""Shang-Chi"" feels like an appropriate apology from Disney to all of their viewers.

At this stage, it feels pointless to complain about Marvel films following the exact same template when introducing new heroes so I won't hold that against this one too much. With that said, thanks to some brilliantly choreographed martial arts fight scenes and gorgeous visuals, director Destin Daniel Cretton (""Just Mercy"") has provided us with one of the most unique looking MCU films to date. One scene near the beginning features Xu Wenwu walking through a bright, beautiful oriental garden complete with bamboo reeds in the foreground. A short time later, he is locked in hand-to-hand combat with his future love interest Li. This reminded me of ""wuxia"" films, a popular subgenre of Chinese martial arts movies, like ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"". In fact, this scene was such a good tribute to that genre that I almost forgot this was a Marvel movie and was instead watching one of those classic Kung Fu films my dad used to show me when I was young. You know you've created something special when your film can appeal this effectively to fans of both Marvel and Kung Fu movies.

Considering the last thing I saw him in was the sitcom ""Kim's Convenience"", Simu Liu definitely took me by surprise as to how well cast he was as the film's main star. I was expecting him to be a wisecracking Americanised version of the Asian hero but he actually plays most of the film straight, only responding humorously when absolutely necessary. His dramatic side truly shines when he is interacting with his onscreen father Tony Leung. In fact, Leung's character Xu has one of the most tragic backstories of any character in the whole MCU, which I won't spoil here. Another surprise was Awkwafina as Shang-Chi's best friend Katy. Rather than being another typical love interest, Katy is instead a loyal platonic friend of his who is willing to help him out no matter how limited her knowledge on the field of battle may be. It also helps that she is responsible for most of the film's comic relief.

With a new superhero now officially introduced, it's safe to assume that ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" has shown an optimistic future for the MCU. Its broad appeal to Eastern and Western audiences alike as well as the usual action-packed fun we've come to expect over the years makes it one of the best origin films to come out of the MCU to date. The Marvel hype train shows no signs of slowing down and if things keep going the way they are, it won't be stopping anytime soon.

1464,1464,"It's very pretty, but the story/plot is mediocre and filled with holes","As far as visuals go, this movie is amazing... like just about as impressive as Dune, it's filled to the brim with eye-candy.

The plot/story however is mediocre and filled with plot holes... the characters' actions are often unrealistic and they will often just 'stare in awe' at their friends being killed, instead of doing the realistic thing, and immediately defending their friends... it's something that happens like 5 times and honestly spoils the movie for me.... if characters in a movie don't act or react realistically and stare at something like a braindead zombie (like their friends getting killed right in front of them, whilst they are holding a gun in their freeking hands), then it's just really terrible script/plot writing.

Overall, the movie isn't as bad as Ant-Man 2 but it's not far behind. Also, Awkwafina's acting style was already old by the 2nd movie she did... ALL of her characters in movies are the same person, and like I said, it got boring after the 2nd movie. I roll my eyes at everything Awkwafina's character does in the movie.

It's a 5/10 movie, not really worth a watch unless you're a real die-hard Marvel fan.","As far as visuals go, this movie is amazing... like just about as impressive as Dune, it's filled to the brim with eye-candy.

1465,1465,There's Dragon Fights!,"What more do you want?

I honestly didn't want to like this film. As you may have read in previous reviews of the Marvel films, they are all dumb. And this one ends as they all do, with just massive CGI chaos. But did I mention they were dragons fighting?

Anyway, the film is fun. Fun and lively in the sense of watching a water painting come to life. The fight sequences are laborious...sometimes. Since being rocked with energy source that could topple buildings doesn't even crack a rib seems silly.

But Shang-Chi makes it work. Here played by the moon-faced wide-eyed and fun loving Simu Liu. And he does a wonderful job NOT wanting to be anything but a typical slacker. While he carries the burden of a darker past..haunted, even...he does his best to make the best of his situation with his San Fran pal Katy. Now usually Awkwafina irritates me to no end. Here, she is much more subdued and is truly a ""bro"" any guy would want in a sisterly form/love interest. The balance of her hip banter to seriousness is flawless. And quite the joy when not on screen.

Big kudos to Tony Leung. Who has spent generations emoting with the most efficient use of words. He doesn't require much and carries a lot. He plays a former evil doer whose only motivation is love.

His fatherly love for his children is only surpassed by regaining a love he's lost. And truly embodies that person who cannot let it go. But that credit goes to Li, played by Fala Chen. A gentle soul in what can be described as Shangri-La. I could watch her do kata for hours. Her gracefulness would make any man want to open the gates of Hell for.

Much praise goes to director Destin Cretton for balancing spirituality with family ties. This is a very difficult line to tow while trying not to be overbearing. He was smart enough to know that the family dynamics of an Asian household have small passive-aggressive moments that pick at the main characters. But doesn't ever go past the ""you must have honor"" trope that infects a movie like ""Mulan""","What more do you want?

Also, there could've been some heavy emotions & more action sequences & some twists/turns in the script to have more grip on the audience. Overall, it was a good watch but could've been still better.","Cool worlds/ten-rings VFX, OKayish plot, good characterisations.

1467,1467,An Asian Marvel Origin story with all the spectacle you've come to expect.,"Another great and entertaining experience which is very similar to what has gone before in format, but the formula works very well and I enjoyed the film a lot. The Asian style and presentation is beautiful, showing off plenty of folklore and style in both modern and traditional settings. The presentation is very stylish, the special effects were superb and the martial arts fight scenes were fast and exciting The plot is good, focusing on the human and family side of the characters rather than the magical, and sets up a good intrigue for the continuation of the MCU. The acting is good and although the comic relief and cute character did change things up, they also spoiled it a bit and made the slow middle section drag on even more. The ending was pretty grand and epic, but I felt it could have been better.","Another great and entertaining experience which is very similar to what has gone before in format, but the formula works very well and I enjoyed the film a lot.

1468,1468,Shades of Bruce Lee...,,
1469,1469,Unique. But a very fun film,"I have to say I was looking forward to this one. First film in a while that had no connection to avengers etc so I was intrigued to see how they would do this. And on the whole it was very enjoyable and fun to watch!

First instincts when watching were a little mixed. It was an odd start to say the least and didn't have any idea how this was going to go. And my first instincts on Katy were also mixed. I felt like they were trying to force the humour out on her and I found her character really annoying. HOWEVER..

Once it gets going the film gets better and better. Katy becomes a great character and all the characters development and arcs on a whole were truly phenomenal! For me the best part of the film was the characters and seeing them all develop throughout.

So is the plot good? To be blunt, yes! It's truly unique and uniquely done in so many ways, I don't want to give out anything that would spoil anything, but it's really not what you expect. That's all I say!



I'll shut up now! I'll just say it's well worth watching. It's a great ""superhero"" to have and a great one to watch. And overall it's a fun, visually pleasing and brilliant watch. I recommend.","I have to say I was looking forward to this one. First film in a while that had no connection to avengers etc so I was intrigued to see how they would do this.

1472,1472,Really enjoyable film 7/10,"Shang - Chi is the new hero of the MCU and everyone is going to love him. Although I have a really deep criticism over fase 4 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I've decided to go watch the movie in theaters (after two years of being away from theaters due to covid). Overall I really enjoyed it. There were still a few moments that I regretted and that were dull. Not to mention ""little mistakes"" that Marvel keep doing with their movies. In general it was a fun experience. The plot didn't have much to offer to be honest: another origin story of a superhero that tries to run away from his fate and responsibilities. Until he is forced to face his past.

This has been the kind of way for Marvel to introduce their new characters in the MCU, I wished they would have been more creative but they do deliver creativity for once. Watching people speak their native language for once was a huge step up for Marvel. The movie is also influenced by many other asian classic films such as ""Hero"", ""Hidden Dragon"", ""Seven Samurai"" and ""In the mood for love"".

Of course it wouldn't be a Marvel movie without some end credits scenes (how original). The end credit scene does confirm the return of Shang Chi at some point, but what the end credits scene does confirm moreover is how the future Marvel films will all get connected. As I said before, I'm less optimistic with this whole fase 4 of Marvel but it wouldn't hurt or kill to watch a few of them. To me, I just wanted to return to the theaters.

Speaking of actors: Simu Liu is a fantastic actor and will definitely become a fan favorite, both him and his character. Awkwafina steals the show every single time she's on screen. Tony Leung is wonderful and acts so well. The whole cast is perfect. If you are in favor of theaters and Marvel movies than go watch Shang Chi.

P. S: the end credit song - Fire in the Sky by Anderson Paak. Is the best part of the movie.","Shang - Chi is the new hero of the MCU and everyone is going to love him.

1473,1473,Shang-chi and the legend of the ten rings,"I have just watched this movie. I am an avid Marvel fan. This film introduces a new character, there is that standard Disney approach, with a mix of comedy, seriousness and lots of action.

Disney work through the numbers on this film, there are no surprises and it does what it does on the tin.

The acting is good, special effects are solids and the story is not bad.

There's continuity linking to the other marvel universe which is nice for the fans.

I would actually pitch this at 7.5/10, not quite an 8 but higher than a 7

Those review of 1 or 2 out of ten are way off the mark, this film is not that bad.","I have just watched this movie. I am an avid Marvel fan. This film introduces a new character, there is that standard Disney approach, with a mix of comedy, seriousness and lots of action.

1476,1476,Awesome.,"Best fight scenes since the civil war airport scene. They mess up simply by trying to make the character 10 years younger then the actor is. But aside from that I thought it was awesome. Plenty of cool action fight scenes, goes a little off the rails at the end with way too much cgi for what was a relatively grounded movie to start. Great addition to MCU , especially after the quality level the shows have been.","Best fight scenes since the civil war airport scene.

1478,1478,Refreshing and Captivating!,"""I gave you ten years to live your life. And where did that get you? You walked in my shadow.""

Marvel Studios' Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings follows Shang-Chi, a seemingly ordinary young man from San Francisco who parks cars for a living alongside his friend, as must confront the past he thought he left behind when he is drawn into the web of the mysterious Ten Rings organization. Marvel took a big chance on this project. Of course we've had lesser known heroes end up getting their own movie franchise within the MCU, but Shang-Chi is not one many know about. Little was known going in other than we'd get some action scenes and explore new territory within the MCU. What they managed to do with Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings is unlike any Marvel movie yet. Destin Daniel Cretton takes a new approach that works wonders. His previous works of Short Term 12 and Just Mercy are heartfelt dramas so something big like this is new territory, but he incorporates the same style and messages into this. The dysfunctional family dynamic serving as the character arc and forming the conflict is so much deeper than some random business guy who wants to rule the world. With this story, it's easy to connect with it and understand character motives. I will say there's a lot to pack in here and the story can get muddy at points, but it pulls itself together that we retain most of everything.

Simu Liu is fantastic in the title role. Previous to watching, I hadn't seen him in anything. But he has all the skills as an emerging actor to be a household name. Shang-Chi is an interesting character to follow. As he discovers and recalls moments from his upbringing, we can slowly piece him together. There's much more to be made from him, but with future installments we'll be able to get much more. And Tony Chiu-Wai Leung is perfectly cast as Xu Wenwu. He's a villain I can understand, like, and dislike all at the same time. He's flawed, but there's depth to him. And he almost steals the show by the end with another showcase of mad acting skills. But the character I've been thinking of a lot, and mainly because she was so hilarious, is Awkwafina as Katy. Awkwafina is one of my favorite actresses working right now, especially after her role in The Farewell, and she smashes this. Katy is the typical comedic sidekick but so much fun. One of the funniest jokes comes from her and I was laughing hysterically. Maybe more character will come from her later, but what we got was enough for me. I can't wait to see her again! I should also mention Meng'er Zhang as Xialing. This is her first role and she's also great. What they'll do with her next should be interesting.

From a technical standpoint, this is impressive for a Marvel movie. There are some stunning visuals. The cinematography isn't that gray color scheme used in most, though it does fall into that later on, and bursting with color. And as you probably know, the visual effects are as good as they come. It's not muddled with CGI and a scene that was completely green screen, which is nice to see. Also, Marvel has been doing great with the themes and score lately because this is another great one, along with the soundtrack. Paired with this are the best fight scenes out of the whole MCU. The stunt choreography is top notch and is beautiful and intense to look at. The bus scene early on is the best yet and will be hard to top! Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings just really did it for me and most everybody can agree. It's refreshing and captivating in every way. Marvel has been taking some big leaps with this new phase and it gets me more and more excited for each new installment!","""I gave you ten years to live your life. And where did that get you?

1479,1479,Marvel goes mystical,"With this film, Marvel shows that there is still no end in sight, and it is getting crazier and more imaginative.

1482,1482,Shang-Chi and the legend of The Ten Rings - enjoyably unMarvellous film. 80%,"""Shang-Chi and the legend of The Ten Rings"" is a superhero origin story which seems more like a Chinese martial arts film than the next entrant in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Many years ago I saw ""Crouching tiger, hidden dragon"" and found the fight scenes in that literally unbelievable a lot of the time. ""Shang-Chi"" often seems subtle in its fight scenes by comparison but then does have action sequences which are more like MCU superhero films. As an origin story, it assumes no familiarity with the MCU and in fact plays mostly as a non-MCU film, which is what I liked about it.

Simu Liu plays Shang-Chi/Shaun, the son of a mobster, Xu Wenwu (played by Tony Leung) who could quite easily have been the subject of a film or franchise himself, due to his legendary characteristics. Shang-Chi's mother Ying Li (played by Fala Chen) is also a legendary kind of character. This contrast of 'Eastern' legendary figures and 'Western' MCU legendary figures worked to the former's advantage, as the latter often come across as plastic toy figurines being used in a sandpit by small boys to play with.

The plot concerns how Shang-Chi/Shaun sought to move from under the shadow of his father to become his own man but just when he thought he was out, he is pulled back into Wenwu's orbit. The film mixes the seriousness, perhaps, of Chinese martial arts films with the jokey style of American Hollywood films. As should be expected from a MCU film, eventually the fate of the world will come into play and someone will have to play the hero to save it.

The martial arts in this film juxtaposes frenetic fight sequences with elegant and fluid fight scenes which have their own particular charm. Other times the action sequences seem lifted from a Disney live action family film and that was enjoyable too, if you just suspended disbelief.

Speaking of comedy, I found the earliest instance of this to be aiming very low for laughs, which isn't uncommon in MCU films but I warmed to later instances of it. For instance, I was amused by the character of a thespian who sounded like he was from Liverpool, when he reminisced about what he took from a film that he saw as a teenager and how that inspired him to get into acting. That actor playing the thespian did seem familiar, perhaps for his voice but I did recognise his name in the closing credits and remembered the role that he is perhaps best known for.

An interesting aspect to this film is its subject matter, i.e. An Asian superhero and a mostly Asian cast. Is this another attempt by Hollywood to crack the now important Chinese market? If it is, then the cooling relations between the US and China is an unwelcome fly in the ointment for Hollywood studios trying to make a lot of money from Chinese cinemagoers.

Another question that came into my mind was whether ""The Ten Rings"" is based on Chinese legend or is a Marvel appropriation of Chinese culture, tailored for 'Western' audiences that don't care about cultural authenticity. If it isn't the former, then I think that there could be a niche for films which mine authentic 'Eastern' legends and myths. That could be something which might interest me (Sinophiles would no doubt reel out a long list of films which have done just that!).

As you might have guessed, I wasn't the first in line to see this film. In fact, I wasn't even sure that I wanted to see it, as I haven't watched every line of superhero films in the MCU (maybe I should watch ""The Black Panther""?). As it stands, I think it was worth the punt in seeing it. I'd go so far as to say that seeing a sequel to this would be more appealing if it wasn't tied to The Avengers franchise! Furthermore, I would have liked this film not to remind that it was part of the MCU, which it managed to do, at least until the closing credits, which I didn't welcome when it made its first appearance. With that being said, this is the kind of film that you could watch again, after a suitable break. Although I didn't watch this film in 3D, it might be worth it to do so (as sometimes the extra cost of the ticket gives added value to the experience and...sometimes it doesn't).

Notes to self:

* The narrative did have some logical gaps in it, for example why Shang-Chi was attacked on the bus. What was that all about?

* The film was dedicated to the memory of Brad Allan, I think. Not sure who that was...searching now, a few websites list him as the supervising stunt coordinator.

* Reading the closing credits, I was reminded that this film was shot in Australia, which isn't obvious watching it, so, good job studio (I think I saw or heard something on ABC in Australia about how Asian Australians got to be in this film, perhaps a kung fu exponent or exponents)!

* My score for this film was tracking from 75% (7 out of 10 stars) to 75+% (8 out 10 stars) to just a flat 80% final score.","""Shang-Chi and the legend of The Ten Rings"" is a superhero origin story which seems more like a Chinese martial arts film than the next entrant in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU).

It's easily the best Marvel movie post-Infinity Saga (I know, that's not exactly saying much), and is very promising for the quality of Marvel's next projects. We have probably the second best villain intimately tied to the origin of a new, entertaining, and capable hero full of potential, in a story that ties the universe together and teases upcoming events in tantalising and unexpected ways. The fight choreography was on point, the dialogue was seeped in cultural significance, the jokes all land, and the CGI is some of the best since Thanos himself. Shang-Chi is an all-out success for Marvel, it seems in multiple ways - both critically and financially. Really its only downfall is that at times this doesn't feel like that much of a movie about Shang-Chi himself purely because his origin is tied so closely to the story of the Ten Rings. Instead it's a Ten Rings movie featuring Shang-Chi, which is fine, but feels a bit weird for his introduction into the MCU. And yes, the Ten Rings are tied up with the Iron Man films perfectly, almost making the whole Aldrich Killian thing better in retrospect. I give Shang-Chi a high 8/10, with promise of moving up with rewatches.","Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings far surpassed any expectations I had.

1484,1484,Feast for the eyes...,"I can't decide whether I loved this movie because it's great or if it's just the best cinematography Bill Pope's done since The Wachowski's ""The Matrix"" trilogy?

Either way, ""Shang-Chi"" is easily the most visually distinctive & stunning film in the MCU thus far - vibrant, kinetic, gorgeously framed / composed, with its own individualistic sense of personality - & the symbiosis between the fight choreography & camera work supercedes that of any previous installment in the Marvel franchise - resulting in an incredible style that works effortlessly throughout... I can't stress this enough - some moments are honestly breathtaking (my jaw was on the floor) & it's an utter joy to see such expertly constructed & perfectly timed sequences - of pure, unapologetic cinema - unfold. Allows the audience the uncommon opportunity to just sit back & relax whilst watching, safe in the knowledge those responsible for bringing the screenplay to life are trustworthy, capable hands. Hence, the creator's dependability reassures viewers that they can simply focus on enjoying the experience instead, making it even more fun.

Although I shouldn't be surprised everything's captured so masterfully - considering the reliably quirky inventiveness of the visionary director of photography at the helm of the project - despite his legendary status, I still wasn't expecting a solo film (made by such an infamously corporate production company which normally shuns creative experimentation of any kind, churning out unadventurous, generic, copy + paste origin stories) to be so shockingly well realised on screen, it would consequently make ""Avengers: Endgame"" look embarrassingly trivial & unengaging by comparison... Yet somehow, under the watchful eye of director Destin Daniel Cretton, together, this duo manage to accomplish exactly that successfully, capturing scenes with a unique confidence I rarely (if ever) see in recent comic book adaptations.

For instance, usually, I can't stand the bland, dull, grey, lifeless aesthetics of Disney movies (renowned for their very ugly colour grading & over reliance on CGI) but the filmmaking here feels as uncharacteristically bold, audacious, awe inspiring, original, immersive & as epic as James Wan's ""Aquaman"" or James Cameron's ""Avatar"", utilising VFX effectively to enhance the scale of the tale being told, rather than detract from the overall plot. Of course, technically impressive world building & enormous scale / grandiosity are meaningless qualities & hollow attributes to possess if the narrative lacks depth or engaging characters but thankfully, this offers just enough heart to additionally feel emotionally investable, as well as spectacular.

Wish I could've seen this in the theatre.","I can't decide whether I loved this movie because it's great or if it's just the best cinematography Bill Pope's done since The Wachowski's ""The Matrix"" trilogy?

1490,1490,Surprisingly good.,"I have to say that this was a surprisingly good movie. I say surprisingly because Marvel (or DC for that matter) have not exactly excelled in making even decent movies for quite some time. That the woke ""critics"" on Rotten Tomatoes gave it high ratings was a bit of a red flag as well but not only was the movie rather free from woke ramblings and preaching but it was a very fun and entertaining movie to watch.

The movie starts off in a somewhat bizarre way with Shang-Chi and his girlfriend swiping a car from a valet parking and going for a joy ride. It turns out that they are telling their story to a couple of friends and that is pretty much how this movie is told.

It begins more or less right away with some nice action and it continues that away with plenty of action sequences intermixed with story telling. The action and martial arts is really good in my opinion. They are in stark contrast to the mediocre rubbish we were treated to in Snake Eyes. The latter which was quite a disappointment.

This movie relies heavily on fantasy elements with tie ins to Doctor Strange, especially towards the end. Another movie that I liked a lot by the way. Thus there are of course plenty of special effects and CGI. Most of them good or very good. I really liked the beautiful world of Ta Lo. The combat scenes, especially when the rings are in action are both cool and beautiful.

There are quite a lot of comical relief in the movie as well and, for once, it is not to silly, outrageous or plain stupid. It contributes well to the enjoyment factor of the movie. The washed out actor is a bit on the limit but otherwise it works well with the rest of the movie. That guy on the bus starting to film and make commentaries was quite hilarious for instance.

The story? Well it is a Marvel special effects movie so one should not expect too much but the story is not bad. It mostly holds together and works well enough to tie all the action together. The acting is pretty much the same thing. One should not expect too much but it is good enough. It was nice to see Michelle Yeoh as Ying Nan though. She was one of the few cool characters in Discovery and she does know how to act.

Overall I very much enjoyed this movie. It is a simple super hero and fantasy adventure story with lots of action and special effects and with the single purpose of entertaining the audience that doesn't fall in the trap of trying to ""educate"" said audience.","I have to say that this was a surprisingly good movie.

1491,1491,Surprisingly entertaining for MCU's 4th phase,"Now that we're finally into the fourth phase of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, we're getting to see the deep cuts from everyone's favorite superhero community. Despite having an unnecessarily long title, 'Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings' is a fun ride that doesn't feel like a retread of Marvel films past.

The introduction to Shaun (Shang-Chi, portrayed by Simu Liu) is handled well, as the character is likable and feels like a good fit among the established members of S. H. I. E. L. D. Comic relief comes in the form of Awkwafina's Katy - sidekick to Shaun - and an atypical showing by Sir Ben Kingsley, while more serious performances are delivered by veteran actors Tony Chiu-Wai Leung and Michelle Yeoh.

As for the plot, it can almost be split in two, as the first and second halves of 'Shang-Chi' feel like completely different films. The first half is very unserious and comes off as a companion to the latest 'Spider-man' entries, whereas the second half is a more traditional Marvel action-drama. Even though there are plenty of typical superhero tropes thrown in here with even more of a Disney imprint than past MCU movies, it's still enjoyable for what it is.

The somewhat surprising strength of 'Shang-Chi' suggests there's no slowing down in the MCU film factory.","Now that we're finally into the fourth phase of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, we're getting to see the deep cuts from everyone's favorite superhero community.

1492,1492,Sort of disappointed..,"I got to admit I wasn't particularly blown away by anything in the movie.. I might even say ""I was bored"" by it.

Don't get me wrong.. it IS a spectacle! The action is great. The locations are nice, costume design, sound design, etc. But it is overall a soft release not worth seeing in theaters.. specially as a follow-up to what Endgame was.

The biggest problem for me, is how the underwritten lead has muddled personality (for reasons covered in the story) devoid of charm, personality or good dialogue.

The next issue is the humor, which didn't land for me.. Not once. The supporting lead Awkwafina isn't her normal ""loud"" self that's supposed to be funny every time she opens her mouth. Her role is very supportive and a little dramatic. And while I questioned myself why was she even there for, it doesn't ultimately matter. She is another forgettable character that is given more importance than the role deserves.

Finally, the third act is weak. There's a balancing problem with stakes. You can't feel tension or weight to any action. And there's a lot of superficial ""I can't do it"" until they can.

In the end, this feels like a very safe plot, written in a way to appeal to china (considering how the Mandarin is portrayed), that ends up appealing to no one specific. Certainly doesn't feel like a Marvel movie.. but it was bound to happen if we are to be introduced to different aspects of the narrative. But it also doesn't feel like a comic book. It's more generic than that.","I got to admit I wasn't particularly blown away by anything in the movie.. I might even say ""I was bored"" by it.

And as it can not miss in marvel movies, the good comedy part too."
1494,1494,Bold & Brilliant,"A bold step for the MCU, incorporating an Eastern cinema approach into it's franchise. With it's foundations built on choreography and humour, Shang-Chi beautifully brings in elements of famed Kung-Fu films and Chinese culture.

The cast, perhaps largely unknown in most of the world, perform excellently and those performances are centred on the movements within the film. Taking inspiration from many martial arts, the action scenes - whilst exaggerated and outlandish in comparison to the film's peers - are brilliant. The addition of Kingsley is truly excellent too, as he and Awkwafina provide the majority of laughs.

A standalone plot whilst maintaining links to the MCU, Shangi-Chi creates a new platform for Marvel to explore, although clearly sets up the next Phase along with other releases from the year. The standout element is the creation of the new world and it's creatures though, a huge Disney budget bringing to life fabled animals long deserving of a spotlight.","A bold step for the MCU, incorporating an Eastern cinema approach into it's franchise.

1495,1495,Shang Chi and the legend of the ten rings,,
1496,1496,The Master of Kung-fu,"Shang chi and the legend of the ten rings we follow the story of a guy named Shang(Simu Liu) who lives your basic life In San Francisco. Working as a Valet parking car, and partying late nights with his best friend Katy(Awkwafina). Until one day a band of assassins targets Shang and it's revealed that he's actually an assassin trained at birth by his father Wenwu(Tony Leung Chiu-Wai). The leader of the ten rings an ancient Chinese organization that's existence for thousands of years, conquering kingdoms and overthrowing governments. Now Shang-Chi must faces his father and overcome the demons of his past. Each of these Marvel films I find most enjoyable is the world building, set up of this universal series. All these characters from various backgrounds and classes and worlds. Shang-Chi I can say is one of those welcome new additions. Similar to Guardians of the galaxy when this was announced I hadn't the slightest idea who this guy was. Usually when people think Martial artists with marvel they usually think Iron fist or daredevil. So going into this I had a blank expectation of what to see. It does pay tribute to old-school martial arts films while mixing fast action charm of a comic book with a blend of Chinese mythology and philosophy. It does helps gives the movie an identity and the characters overall I found them good not great, but I found them entertaining and likable. Shang's more or less just an ordinary guy just trying to live his life. Have fun make a new start and make the best of it. He's honestly more or less happy with his basic life. Though at the same time running from his old life his father,mother and sister. It all leaves an impact on him as a person. He's pretty emotional not Peter Parker emotional, but he still has a personality outside of just having a stoic Shaolin fighter serious persona. They could have easily done a chosen one theme with him that been done to death. He likes to joke and have fun along with his friend Katy. Awkwafina I'm not a fan of her I didn't really care for her in crazy Rich Asians or Raya and the last dragon. Here I found her character more funny and likable. She doesn't really come off as that annoying friend that's more or less in the way. Her and Simu do play well off each other and display this friendship of two different people who still very similar. I got sort of Rush hour vibe off them, there's even a fight scene outside on a bamboo scaffolding. She's not just a pointless tagalong she does have moments where the jokes don't work , though she does add to the film specifically in the finale. The tone of the movie still finds time to flesh them out. More or less the two of them are just goofballs at the beginning, once more's revealed it does take time to have it's more deep serious moments. Wenwu I found to be a really good villain and While technically this still isn't really the Mandarin that comic readers we're probably expecting. His overall character is very compelling he more borders the line like killmonger. You understand his reasons though his actions are unjustifiable. He does still manages to gives off this somewhat opposing demeanor not from his fighting, but from the way he present his self. I buy this guy used to be a tyrant and a Conqueror. I still wish his rings worked the same way though, really he just throws them like chakra and whips them around. As for the sister she's given minimal in this not really alot of moments. Outside of her childhood flash backstory it's clear later down the road their gonna do something her. The visuals are stunning to this one water effect the just pops off the screen. The use of elements being shown through the right use of slow motion. The landscape of Tao lo which has this very traditional Chinese style with Nine-tail foxes, and Fu dog(lions) that make that the rhinos from black panther looks bad. I want to see more places like this in future installments. A lot of these cg effects are on par with doctor strange.","Shang chi and the legend of the ten rings we follow the story of a guy named Shang(Simu Liu) who lives your basic life In San Francisco.

1497,1497,Simply entertaining,"When shang chi was announced in phase 4, i got excited because i am a fan of martial arts films. But after the pandemic, i slowly started losing interest in the film because i felt that mcu won't be as good after endgame and my fear turned true with the post endgame movies. None of the films or series satisfied me. I saw shang chi with low expectations and got fully satisfied.

What i loved about shang chi the most was its entertaining. Post endgame, mcu got burdened with expectations to connect their films into a universe, set up future films and do something different but in that process forgot to provide entertainment. On the other hand, shang chi is not burdened with any of these and tells a simple and independent story. There is no deliberate connecting to the mcu, nor they are in a hurry to set up any sequels, also its not anything different as its a typical Chinese martial arts mythological film. The action scenes in train and skyscraper were mindblowing and best hand to hand action scenes after winter soldier(which black widow failed to provide). The female stars were also badass. The climax cgi action was okay.

Only drawback is there is nothing new in the plot as its that typical mcu storyline where our hero has daddy issues.

On the whole, shang chi and the legend of ten rings is a very good standalone mcu film after thor ragnarok.","When shang chi was announced in phase 4, i got excited because i am a fan of martial arts films.

1499,1499,A diverse new addition,"Shang Chi and the Legend of the Ten rings is one of the marvel's first phase 4 movies. In hindsight it has a underlying tone and story similar to that of Black Panther. Both being representations of certain groups and and their cultures.

The story is solid. It wasn't perfect as it had some minor flaws. A bit cheesy with good writing and comedy but nothing exceptional. The fight scenes , the choreography and dragons were cool which were refreshing compared to the last couple of MCU movies that were released. The characters are nothing to interesting other than Shang Chi and his dad and their whole dynamic.

Overall an enjoyable film. An eyecandy with some flaws but nonetheless was watchable and likable.

Overall an enjoyable film. An eyecandy with some flaws but nonetheless was watchable and likable.

Memorable: No Rewatchable: Unlikely.."
1500,1500,"What a waste of time, the other way around geographically","Too unrealistic movie, with too much special effect that they do not bother to cover up. Humoristic moments do not seem that funny. Also, how a thin someone holdoff a big guy?

Ugh, it is that classic moves of Hollywood and phrases. Like the headphone did not hear you. Or foreigner moving oversea. Suddenly it looks like how they are picturing America especially in the cab. Like your pants joke, hell no phrase when looking at height. Or was looking everywhere for you. Burn it down. Classic moves like using multiple people as a stair.

Hate it also that sometimes they just speak English but mostly Chinese, wondering what they want.

How much did the Chinese pay Disney?

Using big actors and adding a new guy in to keep the quality of the acting, with a bad script it does not do well. Especially when there is no innovative action in the players. They were copy and paste from another movie they played before.

Classic scenarios making it so predictable, and fights that could not be won due to lack of experience are own suddenly.

Acting is below average, quality of screen is high but too much special effect, camera work is OK because it has gotten took over multiple of times by special effects so can not give any real points. Sound is below average because they're using too much overused kinds.

1 time only movie. Points are given to the cast because they still try to make something out of it but still not pulling tit off and meeting the script only. Some points for the innovativeness idea.","Too unrealistic movie, with too much special effect that they do not bother to cover up. Humoristic moments do not seem that funny.

1501,1501,Destin Daniel Cretton; you've done it again!,"Marvel's latest feature introduces cinephiles to Shaun AKA Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) a martial arts master and a character created by Steve Englehart and Jim Starlin, first appearing in a Marvel publication back in 1973. Beginning in the first of many gorgeously choreographed and shot sequences, we're introduced to Shang-Chi's father Xu Wenwu (Tony Chiu-Wai Leung) and mother Li (Fala Chen) also entailing the awesome power of the Ten Rings which Xu currently has in his possession. What follows is a heart-pounding and ridiculously entertaining adventure movie with true heart.

Filled with beautiful performances not least from everyone already mentioned and including Awkwafina as Shaun's best friends Katy and Meng'er Zhang as sister Xialing, there's plenty here to adore on screen not even getting to the truly awe-inspiring action set pieces with the best fight scenes I've seen in recent memory. Cretton (Short Term 12, Just Mercy) is very quickly becoming one of my favourite directors having produced three incredible pieces of cinema in the last 8 years. It's great to see that his passion for storytelling and independent spirit still shines through his latest here while also staying true to the Marvel fan base (I really did not expect a certain character to show up but made for some really comical moments).

The visual effects are of course stunning but what makes them stand out here are how they're incorporated with the beautiful landscapes to enhance the feeling of authentically experiencing Shaun's heritage and getting wrapped up in the culture that the filmmakers so wonderfully explore. This is how origin stories should be made! The creature design is also incredible and is an integral element to making the final sequences all the more breathtaking.

Please do yourselves a favour and see this on the biggest screens possible, please support your local cinema and stay safe my friends.","Marvel's latest feature introduces cinephiles to Shaun AKA Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) a martial arts master and a character created by Steve Englehart and Jim Starlin, first appearing in a Marvel publication back in 1973.

1502,1502,Not a good movie,"This movie was a fist in the face or rather a razor fist. I don't know if the movie is bad or I can't watch Marvel movies anymore but I didn't like anything about this movie, neither the story, nor the special effects, nor the acting. It all seemed too exaggerated and predictable, plus two hours is really too much for a movie of this type.

The only interesting parts were the first minutes where you see the meeting between the parents and the clash between the abomination and the monk whose name I don't remember.

I think instead the worst part was the final battle, even the too long and exaggerated one.","This movie was a fist in the face or rather a razor fist.

This is the first time I felt sleepy for an action movie. I feel like i wasted my money, despite availing the Super Tuesday offer. The Suicide Squad was far much better in terms of storyboard.

The first half of the film was very good, the story, and especially the impressive fight scenes. However, later in the film we constantly get some new elements, the story expands, there is not always an explanation, and the worst part of the film was my last fight because I think they went too far with special effects, for me personally it was not watchable. The bad guys overall were just solid, nothing special. Of course, at the end of the film we have a scene that shows us how to look for (at least) another film.","Solid pop corn film.

1505,1505,Finally something good again from Marvel,"Marvel has not done much good lately. 2 horrible TV shows, and 1 bad TV show. Not a single good movie since Captain Marvel, and nothing seemingly good coming over the horizon.

To be honest I have started to give up. Marvel have produced magnificent movies and great entertainment for many years, but lately it is like that magic has come off and they seem much more run of the mill basic with that, by now, boring Marvel feel. Marvel has tried to introduce more political correctness, more feminism, and more nonsense diversity, and it has all failed.

This movie however is not a failure.

Why?

This movie is simple, it is to the point, it follows tropes, cliches, and it is a classic heroes journey - which is exactly why it works!

Marvel took a classical story we all heard, read and seen before but they switched a few things around, kept some of that Marvel feel, and made it play out mainly in China and almost only with Chinese actors. And it works!

Imagine that? Sure you can find some political nonsense if you look hard enough, but who cares when you have great fight scenes, lovely sceneries, a great (but basic) story and brilliant well written characters.

We even get a villain that you understand, sympathise with and even feel a sting of ""ah, too bad"" about him.

This is how you make an action movie! Great stuff Marvel!

The points I deduct is due to the movie not being that amazing. They pull the heroes journey of sure, but we have also seen it done better. Sound is great, but not amazing, directing is great, but not amazing, etc. Etc. Everything about this movie is high class, greatly done, and well performed, but it is not on top, it is not amazing nor perfect.

I also have a few objections about the background story and the ending, but I am keeping this spoiler free so...

8/10. This is a great movie and highly entertaining, and definitely worth the ticket price. Go see and get your faith in Marvel restored.","Marvel has not done much good lately. 2 horrible TV shows, and 1 bad TV show.

At the very top tier of MCU movies - characters, lore, acting, action, fighting, visual effects! :-)","The entire cast was perfect, especially Simu Liu, Awkwafina, Tony Leung, Michelle Yeoh, Ben Kingsley, and Ronny Chieng! :-) Spectacular visual effects -and- awesome fight scenes! :-)","The entire cast was perfect, especially Simu Liu, Awkwafina, Tony Leung, Michelle Yeoh, Ben Kingsley, and Ronny Chieng! :-) Spectacular visual effects -and- awesome fight scenes! :-)"
1509,1509,"With Shang-Chi, Marvel presents their first Asian superhero in a good and cultural way.","Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is a new superhero movie in the Marvel film series. The film is directed and written in part by Destin Daniel Cretton, the director of Short Term 12 and Just Mercy.

The film is about Shaun (Simu Liu), who tries to put his past behind him and just wants to enjoy his life with his best friend Katy (Awkwafina). When the mysterious organization the Ten Rings finds Shaun, he is forced to confront his past after all. To do this, he must take his birth name Shang-Chi again, to protect Katy and his sister Xialing (Meng'er Zhang) from the actions of the Ten Rings and their leader Xu WenWu the Mandarin (Tony Chiu-Wai Leung) who is also Shaun. His father.

This film is Marvel's first superhero film starring an Asian actor. Furthermore, with this film they also bring out the Asian culture and fighting styles well. For this they have used other movies like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon as an example. Fans of this film can recognize moments that refer back to these films. They portray the fight scenes where characters fight each other with Asian fighting styles well and entertainingly. The art of the Asian fighting style is somewhat overshadowed when characters use more supernatural powers in the film. Fight scenes where this happens are less exciting and entertaining than scenes where characters fight each other in more normal ways.

At one point, the film also feels like you're watching a live-action mix of the Asian animation shows Pokémon and Avatar: The Last Airbender. These scenes provide some extra comedy and are especially more entertaining for younger viewers. The movies and costumes of the film cast also help with the emergence of Asian culture in the film. The visual effects are also put to good use in the film. Except for a few scenes, it can be seen that they have used a green screen for the background, but fortunately this is not disturbing in the film. Creatures can also be returned before the start of the film. A bit redundant on a few action scenes with 3D effects in the film.

The acting is well done by the film cast. Simu Liu took to Twitter to ask Marvel to play the part, with both parties quickly making a good deal. Simu Liu comes across as good and charismatic as the lead of the film and further conveys the action sequences beautifully. Along with Awkwafina, he also has good chemistry in the film and together provide good appropriate humor. The comedy also doesn't overshadow all the dramatic aspects in the film, which sometimes does happen. Tony Chiu-Wai Leung also portrays the villain of the film in a good and sympathetic way, so that as a viewer you understand why he does what he is doing to me. This film is also only his first English-language role in an American film. Although this is only his first time, he still delivers good and appropriate acting. Meng'er Zhang does not get that much time in the film, but a bit less good or present in the film.","Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is a new superhero movie in the Marvel film series.

The storyline was alright but the CG was very good. They used lots of Chinese culture tradition, costume & symbols. Looking forward to see the next sequel.","When the movie first started...

Though it had a predictable plot just like other Disney films, due to its brilliant execution you'll be glued to the screen. Awkwafina as Katy was my favourite character of the film as all the comedy punches were delivered through her character.

There is no humour. No sense of fun. It feels like a generic kung fu movie and that we have seen it all before.. I saw the ending way before we got there and above all, it was boring.

It depends a lot on the visual effects, its main characters can be funny but not nice, the story does not generate much interest and we have seen the fights many times and in a better way in almost any film produced in Hong Kong, Indonesia or Thailand of the last twenty years. The only thing that saves this film is the karaoke scene that is unexpectedly welcome. The rest is routine, mediocre, tiring and bland.","Let's agree that it is a bad movie from multiple points of view.

I think it's a good thing to have such a major and big representation of Asian characters, especially nowadays with Anti-Asian hate/crime rising.

1522,1522,Chinese culture goes to the world,,
1523,1523,Another fabulous addition to MCU's Phase 4!,"The much-awaited Shangi Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings released today in theatres. It follows the journey of Shang Chi (Simu Liu), the son of the famed MCU villain the Mandarin, who revolts against his father to fight evil.

The first stand-alone film featuring an Asian American superhero, Shang Chi understandably stands out with its close combat sequences. All the actors and especially Simu Liu have undergone extensive martial arts training and it shows, with a sensational sequence on a moving bus in San Francisco and another on a bamboo scaffolding in Macau, the standouts.

Awkwafina and a surprise returning character from the MCU provide genuine, sarcasm-laced comedy that adds another wonderful layer to the experience. Cameos from Benedict Wong and Ronnie Chieng also manage to leave the audience in spits.

Without stooping to cultural appropriation, with an all-Asian crew, director Destin Daniel Cretton pays rich tribute to Chinese heritage at every turn. Hong Kong's superstars Tony Leung and Michelle Yeoh are electric in their roles and the fact that they don't seem to have lost a step with age, acing their action sequences, shows their dedication as performers.

Regarded as one of the finest actor's Chinese cinema has every produced, Tony Leung stamps his class all over the film, giving an engrossing, captivating performance as the dreaded leader of the Ten Rings.

His inner moral dilemmas and love/hate relationship with his children are portrayed brilliantly by the man nicknamed 'Small Tiger' among the Five Tiger Generals of Hong Kong Cinema

The flashback sequences help to build up Shang Chi as a character and intricately captures his upbringing as the heir-apparent to a genocidal megalomaniac, and how despite wanting nothing to do with his father's murderous tendencies, as his son, he is inadvertently drawn to the Mandarin's world of violence and carnage.

The films delves into mystical elements towards the climax and with two surprise-laden post-credit sequences tie into both Doctor Strange's world of Mystic Arts as well as a possible connection that the Ten Rings has to alien technology.

As always, the way weaves in each individual fim character to the wonderful tapestry that makes up each of its Phases is a joy in itself.

It is due to the well-written characters and the nuanced acting of its performers that Shang Chi stands out while the eye-catching CGI and elaborately chorographer action sequences add more gloss to the end product.

Another wonderful new addition to the MCU world and hopefully this paves the way for more ethnicities being represented in the universe as time goes on.

Highly recommended. A must watch. Marvel's Phase 4 continues to raise the bar!","The much-awaited Shangi Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings released today in theatres. It follows the journey of Shang Chi (Simu Liu), the son of the famed MCU villain the Mandarin, who revolts against his father to fight evil.

The first stand-alone film featuring an Asian American superhero, Shang Chi understandably stands out with its close combat sequences. All the actors and especially Simu Liu have undergone extensive martial arts training and it shows, with a sensational sequence on a moving bus in San Francisco and another on a bamboo scaffolding in Macau, the standouts.

Awkwafina and a surprise returning character from the MCU provide genuine, sarcasm-laced comedy that adds another wonderful layer to the experience. Cameos from Benedict Wong and Ronnie Chieng also manage to leave the audience in spits.

Without stooping to cultural appropriation, with an all-Asian crew, director Destin Daniel Cretton pays rich tribute to Chinese heritage at every turn. Hong Kong's superstars Tony Leung and Michelle Yeoh are electric in their roles and the fact that they don't seem to have lost a step with age, acing their action sequences, shows their dedication as performers.

Regarded as one of the finest actor's Chinese cinema has every produced, Tony Leung stamps his class all over the film, giving an engrossing, captivating performance as the dreaded leader of the Ten Rings.

1524,1524,Miscast,"I'm sorry but the leading man here is a definite miscast. Or is it because Tony Leung and Awkwfina stole the show? Hmmmmmm......

While the MCU movies are getting too formulaic I'm hesitant to say the next 10 year is starting out rather uninteresting. Shang Chi is basically a Chinese cash grab in the lineage of Black Panther. It is uninspiring, routine and CGI oriented.

Back to casting the main lead, I'm suggesting either John Cho (star trek, Cowboy Bobep,) or Chang Chen (Dune) would be an upgrade. While Falan Chen is sufficient the role is a thankless one. As to the story I would love to see more of grandma and take out Ben Kingsley's.

I mean Hawkeye series is better, if how so ever slightly. I understand the fantastic elements are tributes to the Chinese culture. Of course Kingsley and that strange pet is trying hard to be comedic but is rather forced. Overall it's a surface scratcher only. So disappointed.","I'm sorry but the leading man here is a definite miscast. Or is it because Tony Leung and Awkwfina stole the show? Hmmmmmm......

Thanks to scintillating cast who lit up the screen especially charismatic Tony Leung.

Chemistry between Simu & Awkwafina as besties are undeniably good.

Action scenes including CGI works definitely made some nice highlights.

1526,1526,New Avenger has Arrived!!!,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is one of the biggest MCU film ever made, with loads of action, Kung Fu, and lots of fun. Simi Liu has nailed the new superhero character. The choreography was brilliant, the VFX was pretty well done, and the cast and crew did such an amazing job making this movie happen. I hope we get to see Shang-Chi once again, maybe in the new Avengers or the sequel if they make that happen in the future of the MCU.

1527,1527,I give it Ten Rings!,"Let me commence by saying this movie is by far one of the most-fun, action packed Marvel movies ever!

Simu Liu is the perfect Marvel protagonist, and Awkwafina delivers the obligatory yet welcomed dose of humor you'd come to expect from a Marvel presentation.

But beyond that this movie is rich with mythology, adventure, and incredible martial arts combat that cannot be described with another phrase other than breathtaking, to be the introduction of a new character the story is well-written and you feel as if he had been with us from the start,

I give this move the 10 it deserves, In Marvel We Trust.","Let me commence by saying this movie is by far one of the most-fun, action packed Marvel movies ever!

My favourite Chinese lady actress (of whose films I have seen nearly all), Michelle Yeoh, is her usual perfect self.

This movie is the Asian one, taking inspiration from Chinese Mythology and Kung-Fu in this action-adventure. Great fight scenes and chases expertly shot, the downside is that most of it looks entirely computer generated. The comedian I don't like made me disappointed again, but once the 2nd comedic side kick joined it was a lot more funny. Strong start, middling middle and an ending which lacked motivation.

That being said, the middle 45 minutes of this film had me nearly falling asleep, literally. The character development just couldn't hook me at all because it felt like they kept revisiting the same points.

On a positive note, the visuals and martial arts are absolutely spectacular. The first act of the film contains most of the martial arts and it is so crisp and well-choreographed. The final act flexes all of the CGI dollas and they make they already big budget stretch far, with some of the more impressive sights you will see in a Marvel movie so far. This movie didn't quite hit the 8/10 for me to recommend people see it in theatres, but lets tack that up to me being tired and you go see it anyway!","Let me preface this by saying that my enjoyment of the movie may have been dampered by a poor night's sleep.

1535,1535,Vey Nice,"Thoroughly enjoyed watching this movie. Not one bit is boring and the comedy is really good and appropriate and not cringey like some other Marvel movies.

This is not an ""8"" 8 for me, but it's not a 7 either, more like 7.6 but then again, IMDb doesn't have half stars for some reasons.

The fight choreography is amazing and this one has some of the best hand-to-hand action in Marvel. It kinda gets ridiculous in the end and you feel like it's not in the MCU, but MCU is already ridiculous so this is not that far-fetched.

The acting of all of them was good especially the father.

The ""villain"" is really relatable and well-written, even though I felt like we needed more time with him, this much is enough to make you actually feel and understand why he does what he does and is kinda not the bad guy.

The story and characters could've used some more fleshing out, especially Shaun's sister.

Story and characters might be cliché but they use those clichés well and make you care about these characters and that's the most important part. I just wish there was more showing and not telling.

The CGI was not that good and it's really noticeable especially at the end. They should've worked on it more and polished it.

Not using gore and cuss words because they want their movies to be PG-13 really hurts these movies, even though they can use at least one f word but for some reason they don't, I'm not saying that f word can make the movie better, but sometimes you need something more than ""dam"" for the scene to be more impactful. Also, doesn't actually showing most of the flashbacks make them more impactful? Why does the camera turn away from the ""death"" scenes that can make the movie better? This is why not showing a little bit of blood and gore hurts these movies, these movies keep pulling their punches back, and believe me no one cares if you used some more gruesome scenes. How are you gonna make a Deadpool 3 and Blade movie then?

All in all, very enjoyable movie with good martial arts fights, characters, music choice, and a decent story. I might like it better when I see it a second time, but right now I'm kinda lukewarm about it. Really looking forward to seeing more of what Shang-Chi's gonna do in the MCU.","Thoroughly enjoyed watching this movie.

The actors for all these characters were also perfect. They suited their roles perfectly. In my opinion, this movie had some of the best supporting characters in the MCU. I also loved the action. It was absolutely amazing, there were some points in the movie where I felt like I was watching a martial arts movie. The stunts and the choreography were perfect, I couldn't have asked for anything more. The effects in this movie were also stunning. The moving forest, the mythical creatures (especially the dragon), and the effects used on the Ten Rings were super cool. The effects in this movie were some of the best in the MCU. Lastly, I also loved the plot, it just sat really well with me.

This movie was like nothing we have ever seen before in the MCU. It was very unique and a nice twist for Marvel. The first Credit Scene was also very interesting and might have set up phase 4 in the MCU.

1538,1538,A solid superhero adventure...,"Like many, I was concerned that this new Marvel Cinematic Universe saga would have trouble living up to previous standards but Shang-Chi has already left me hopeful for the series' future. I literally know nothing about this character but I found his film debut to be a solid superhero adventure; well acted, effectively character-driven, occasionally funny, rich with cultural representation and booming with swift and stylized martial arts action. It has what I hoped I was going to get from Black Panther: inclusivity AND an interesting world and narrative. I'm 100% all for representation but the story and characters must be pronounced, too and I just found this entry to be a lot more distinguished and captivating.

Although Shang-Chi treads the familiar origin story formula, there's a few fresh twists and turns that uniquely sets this character's journey apart from the others. Though the first half is decently entertaining with some identifiable drama and fast-paced yet slightly derivative set-pieces in urban environments, the second half is where the film really turns on (at least for me). The Chinese philosophy kicks in, the mythology is abundant, there's tons of visually striking imagery, a fantastical setting, loads of insane action choreography. The Asian representation is just off the chain and I was so enraptured by it. It doesn't feel contrived, I sensed a great deal of respect for it and all the while an engaging story was unfolding. A nice balance. I was very satisfied with what I saw. I'm really looking forward to seeing more of Shang-Chi's world and how it'll tie in with other stories yet-to-come. Very cool movie.

1547,1547,Worst story and plot ever.,"This is by far the most nonsensical plot in a Marvel film and one of the worst stories I've ever witnessed. It's so hard to make sense of anything at all in this film. The only good thing is some of the action sequences. Bus fight is spectacular but after that it goes completely downhill cause only after that does the plot actually unfold. And it is so ridiculous and so full of nonsense that I was thoroughly bored whenever anything other than the fight scenes were on.

I think Marvel is done. This phase seems completely relying on the success of the previous one. The only good thing is Spider-Man and I'm eagerly looking forward to No Way Home. After this I don't have any expectations from Marvel films other than Spider-Man.

The humour in this movie is pure cringe. It feels too forced and Awkwafina is completely out of place. The last scene where they sing Hotel California is so damn cringy. It's a tragedy that they thought people would enjoy it. This is a really bad film minus the action sequences. Watch it only for the action which looks good on the big screen. Don't have even the slightest expectation from the story.","This is by far the most nonsensical plot in a Marvel film and one of the worst stories I've ever witnessed.

Although Simu Liu falters a little bit as a leading man, he has a truly impressive cast to support him. Awkwafina is brilliantly funny and quippy as she always is. And Tony Leung, the complex antagonist and the hero's father, has the most depth in this film.

The visual effects are beyond beautiful. They reminded me of Ferngully, and the nature I observed as a child. Good stuff!

There are some surprising cameos that are both hilarious and wholesome.

It was so good to see it in Imax after such a long cinema hiatus. Definitely check this one out!","I'm not someone who is a fan of action movies. I'm really not.

Shang-Chi And The Legend Of The Ten Rings mark MCU's first Asian-led superhero film. There had been Asian characters before, inclusive of Wong (Benedict Wong) from Doctor Strange and Hogun (Tadanobu Asano) from Thor. But they have constantly been sidekicks, flunkeys, or comedian relief.

Wenwu is a powerful crime lord who runs an evil empire constructed across the energy of ten historical earrings that he makes use of to generate blasts of energy.

Shang-Chi is a heart-warming tale syringed with humor. Co-writer-director Destin Daniel Cretton knows his circle of relative dynamics and superbly units the tone. Despite the humanity on show, it is the revolutionary martial arts that are the USP. The movement would not depend closely on virtual trickery withinside the actual world.

The chemistry among the actors is palpable, exuding an actual feel of a located own circle of relatives. The film's actual villain is grief, pushed via way of means of Wenwu at the cost of his children.

1564,1564,Surprisingly good!,,
1565,1565,Some Underwhelming Parts but very Good on the Whole,"I've been watching Marvel films for years and while I do almost always enjoy them I often come out underwhelmed, Shang Chi actually managed to pleasantly surprise me and while I do think it dragged slightly in the third act I really enjoyed it.

The film manages to balance it's humour and seriousness far better than other marvel property's and also incorporates aspects from other films without feeling too forced, instead adding to the worldbuilding. The action is possibly the best of any Marvel film and obviously takes a lot of influence from Jackie Chan films with I believe the stunt coordinator having worked with Chan in the past. The acting is all good with Simu Liu really shining and while I wasn't a massive fan of Awkwafina's character at the start I did find myself liking her development in the final act, I think Shang Chi manages to take what works so well about the MCU and polish it but this doesn't mean it's without it's flaws.

I did enjoy the emotional link between the villain and Shang Chi, but I thought that there were far too many flash backs telling us of how this relationship has developed, I also think that the third act was a bit of a let down with the action evolving into pretty basic CGI fights and most of the personal edge that lent itself so well to the rivalry between Shang Chi and Win Wu being lost. There are also some big plot holes and things that just don't make sense, the score is underwhelming and I'm not a massive fan of some of the villain's costume designs, however while this film does have it's flaws it was still a very enjoyable movie that I will likely watch again, the cast is good, cinematography different from the usual stuff the MCU has to offer and I like that Marvel didn't shy away from using a lot of subtitles and having characters speaking lot's of Chinese. Very enjoyable and I'd recommend it to any Marvel fan. 7/10.","I've been watching Marvel films for years and while I do almost always enjoy them I often come out underwhelmed, Shang Chi actually managed to pleasantly surprise me and while I do think it dragged slightly in the third act I really enjoyed it.

1566,1566,"""Welcome to the circus""","It's always fun to go to the theater for a new MCU production -- a chance to see something **new** that you know will be well produced and will keep on stretching their shared universe of superheros. With Shang-Chi it looks like their Phase 4 is well and truly launched, and you can already glimpse what Marvel Studios' overall approach is going to be. (More below.)

Just like Black Widow was Marvel's run at doing a James Bond-type film, Shang-Chi is their try at doing the Chinese martial arts thing. The result is a kind of compromise Westernized version that falls between two poles. For sure though, you'll be entertained. There's more than enough action, a lot of strikingly beautiful settings, and fun characters. But before I forget -- the mid-credits scene is one of the best they've ever done and totally worth staying for. (That's where the quote I put in the title above comes from -- a certain familiar character telling Shang-Chi to sure, come on in and join the craziness.) It does the usual thing of tossing the baton forward to whatever the next production will be, but it's stylistically so clever that it really stands out.

And the film itself: it fills up its 2:12 runtime with a whole lot of material and a lot of characters. Maybe too much. The third act in particular veers off onto a fantasy-type track that doesn't entirely fit well with the previous hour and a half of setup, and the scenes in that last section suddenly feel more rushed. Gone are the days of the first Iron Man or Thor or Ant-Man movies with their lean, linear storylines and single well defined themes. Instead, Marvel now seems to want to overstuff every one of their productions, even if they involve 'secondary' MCU characters, and turn them into epics. More and bigger is not always better, is it?

I did like the cast. Marvel always does an impressive job bringing in good people. Nice to see there are no less than 4 (!) major roles for females, as opposed to 2 for males, and they mix and match well. Of the mostly young cast though, I thought the older pair (Tony Leung, Michelle Yeoh) really stood out -- they effortlessly dominate the screen when they are on. Leung's character could have been a stock, one-dimensional scenery-chewing villain, but he's much more nuanced than that. Simu Liu (the lead role, Shang-Chi) is not exactly a great actor just yet, but he's athletic and cute and attractive with a sense of humor and for this role he doesn't need to be much more than that. Awkwafina, as Katy, does her usual turn with comic relief and side commentary with a dash of romance. As for Trevor Slattery (Ben Kingsley) -- that came out of nowhere and he's absolutely out of place, but somehow it works partly because of his pet that rises to Disney levels of cuteness.

About Phase 4. The first three cycles introduced and used particular major characters that were all required to fit under the Avengers umbrella. Now it's the post-Avengers era and from their scheduled series of releases up through 2023, we'll see a much more diverse slate of characters and stories that don't obviously fall under a single umbrella. If they do have a Master Plan for something equivalent to the Avengers, it's hard to see what it is. Maybe, they'll use this new freedom just to show us interesting stories in a bigger universe.","It's always fun to go to the theater for a new MCU production -- a chance to see something **new** that you know will be well produced and will keep on stretching their shared universe of superheros.

1570,1570,"""Shang-Chi"" Brings Balance to the MCU","For nearly ten years after its inception, the Marvel Cinematic Universe was dominated by the adventures of white men. Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow had to fight to get her own film this year, while her male co-stars got entire trilogies . ""Black Panther"" reinvigorated the franchise with its celebration of African culture in 2018, proving that the Marvel brand didn't have to be so beige. ""Captain Marvel"" became the first MCU film to be fronted by a woman. Now, ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" marks the first Asian-led film. Not only does the film feature the first Asian protagonist, it also features a predominantly Asian cast and crew, which, thankfully, give this franchise a much needed change in perspective.

The Ten Rings have been around for nearly a thousand years, gifting their wearer, Wenwu, immortality so that he may rule with unmatched strength. After centuries of building an empire out of blood, Wenwu was turned away from a life of violence by Ying Li, a guardian of the mystical land of Ta Lo. When heartbreak struck shortly after, Wenwu picked up the rings once again, causing him to go down a dark path, and his son, Shang-Chi, to run away to the United States. Now after ten years, the son must come home to confront his father and become who he was truly meant to be.

Similar to what Ryan Coogler was able to do with ""Black Panther"", co-writer/director Destin Daniel Cretton brings out the best of this new world as he is able to handle the mountains of establishing exposition. His use of flashbacks may be a bit liberal, especially as the film reaches its climax, but they're used meaningfully to build upon a story focused on character and culture.

Without a leading acting credit to his name, Simu Liu takes the titular role by storm as he navigates this typical hero's journey with charm and composure. Mixing a bit of T'Challa with Tony Stark, Shang-Chi is a hero battling with his past and future. Liu and Cretton strike a great balance as Liu hands himself over to Cretton's material in the somber moments, and Cretton lets Liu's comedic instincts light up the room.

Veteran Tony Leung brings the same melancholic energy to Wenwu as he did in his roles with Wong Kar-wai, particularly his work in ""In the Mood for Love."" Leung layers this villain and distances him from the average world dominator. He carries a stillness about him that inspires fear and compassion, two things that have made some of the greatest villains.

The overall narrative within a Marvel film is evenly composed of the plot and the action. Thankfully, Cretton blends both those halves together as he imbues the setpieces with the qualities of the wuxia genre, taking after such films as Ang Lee's ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" (also starring Michelle Yeoh) and Zhang Yimou's ""House of Flying Daggers."" The action often tells as much of the story as the dialogue, particularly in the gracefully dazzling opening sequence. But there's also room for brutality as the first act ends with a tower-scaffolding brawl where Shang-Chi's emotions turn him into a raw killer. Not since ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" has the action been so impactful on a technical and emotional level.

When allowed to be its own film, ""Shang-Chi"" is quite the spectacle. But when it gets forcefully molded into a Marvel film, the results are less than stellar. Even after all his work with the story and action, Cretton can't break free from the third-act visual effects extravaganza that holds this franchise like an iron vice. It's a shame as the smaller familial moments do more for the mind and soul than the forgettable litany of explosions that encompass the final thirty minutes. Being that this is the 25th film in the franchise, I've come to expect that level of disappointment.

Thanks to its multi-talented cast and crew, ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" is one of the better origin stories within the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The action may (rightfully) be the selling point, but the heart of the film lies within its characters, telling a familiar story on an impressive scale.","For nearly ten years after its inception, the Marvel Cinematic Universe was dominated by the adventures of white men. Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow had to fight to get her own film this year, while her male co-stars got entire trilogies . ""Black Panther"" reinvigorated the franchise with its celebration of African culture in 2018, proving that the Marvel brand didn't have to be so beige. ""Captain Marvel"" became the first MCU film to be fronted by a woman. Now, ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" marks the first Asian-led film. Not only does the film feature the first Asian protagonist, it also features a predominantly Asian cast and crew, which, thankfully, give this franchise a much needed change in perspective.

The Ten Rings have been around for nearly a thousand years, gifting their wearer, Wenwu, immortality so that he may rule with unmatched strength. After centuries of building an empire out of blood, Wenwu was turned away from a life of violence by Ying Li, a guardian of the mystical land of Ta Lo. When heartbreak struck shortly after, Wenwu picked up the rings once again, causing him to go down a dark path, and his son, Shang-Chi, to run away to the United States. Now after ten years, the son must come home to confront his father and become who he was truly meant to be.

Similar to what Ryan Coogler was able to do with ""Black Panther"", co-writer/director Destin Daniel Cretton brings out the best of this new world as he is able to handle the mountains of establishing exposition. His use of flashbacks may be a bit liberal, especially as the film reaches its climax, but they're used meaningfully to build upon a story focused on character and culture.

Without a leading acting credit to his name, Simu Liu takes the titular role by storm as he navigates this typical hero's journey with charm and composure. Mixing a bit of T'Challa with Tony Stark, Shang-Chi is a hero battling with his past and future. Liu and Cretton strike a great balance as Liu hands himself over to Cretton's material in the somber moments, and Cretton lets Liu's comedic instincts light up the room.

Veteran Tony Leung brings the same melancholic energy to Wenwu as he did in his roles with Wong Kar-wai, particularly his work in ""In the Mood for Love."" Leung layers this villain and distances him from the average world dominator. He carries a stillness about him that inspires fear and compassion, two things that have made some of the greatest villains.

The overall narrative within a Marvel film is evenly composed of the plot and the action. Thankfully, Cretton blends both those halves together as he imbues the setpieces with the qualities of the wuxia genre, taking after such films as Ang Lee's ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" (also starring Michelle Yeoh) and Zhang Yimou's ""House of Flying Daggers."" The action often tells as much of the story as the dialogue, particularly in the gracefully dazzling opening sequence. But there's also room for brutality as the first act ends with a tower-scaffolding brawl where Shang-Chi's emotions turn him into a raw killer. Not since ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" has the action been so impactful on a technical and emotional level.

When allowed to be its own film, ""Shang-Chi"" is quite the spectacle. But when it gets forcefully molded into a Marvel film, the results are less than stellar. Even after all his work with the story and action, Cretton can't break free from the third-act visual effects extravaganza that holds this franchise like an iron vice. It's a shame as the smaller familial moments do more for the mind and soul than the forgettable litany of explosions that encompass the final thirty minutes. Being that this is the 25th film in the franchise, I've come to expect that level of disappointment.

Thanks to its multi-talented cast and crew, ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" is one of the better origin stories within the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The action may (rightfully) be the selling point, but the heart of the film lies within its characters, telling a familiar story on an impressive scale."

1572,1572,Thrilling & Funny,"This movie gave me hope that there are still bright days ahead for the MCU. Shang-Chi is very different from what we've seen in the past but it's so good. It's visually stunning and the action sequences are thrilling. It had the quality of action that I was expecting from Black Panther. The ten rings are fascinating to watch in use. There were such epic moments that I had to rewind and watch again a few times. I really wish I could have seen this is IMAX. It's one of the few movies that would have been a truly special experience.

With a story like this one, things could have very easily taken a downward turn into the realm of cheesiness and over the top. But it's all done so well. The comedy and serious moments are balanced really well. There are some real laugh out loud moments but the movie never feels silly. The back-flashes are interesting and meaningful.

One of my favorite surprises of this movie, is that it redeems the worst villain twist of the MCU. You know Marvel and Disney have done well when we look forward to seeing these new characters in the future.","This movie gave me hope that there are still bright days ahead for the MCU.

1576,1576,Chinese culture finally done right,"After the Mulan remake, it was safe to say that I was thoroughly disappointed, the portrayal of Chinese culture, even in the mystical sense, just felt like a disaster. But this one, oh this one was so much better. I was actually impressed. It felt like it was actually catered to a different market this time. While someone unfamiliar with Chinese culture may find it to be 'just another Marvel movie(albeit an amazing one), to those who know, you will be treated to something that has been basically non existent in Hollywood films, aka inside jokes/depth of knowledge that really helps elevate the film to a whole nother level.","After the Mulan remake, it was safe to say that I was thoroughly disappointed, the portrayal of Chinese culture, even in the mystical sense, just felt like a disaster.

1578,1578,It's a Kung-Fu movie,,
1579,1579,Great superhero entertainment with a classic storyline,"The charm of this movie comes from the setting of the main characters, showing a reflection of today's world, where Asian culture and the way of life in the west creates an environment of searching for one's own identity and place - this is where we meet Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) first. A young adult trying to navigate through his life far away from his family in the city of San Francisco. His partner in crime is his best female friend Katy (Awkwafina).

Simu Liu's character arc in this film is not significant. Although he makes a solid protagonist, his own character development is de minimis. Awkwafina, by contrast, steals the film as the ordinary person caught up in the epic power struggle. Her trademark zingers and bemused quips make her the perfect foil against the escapist superhero world that she- and we as the audience- are thrust into. Mandarin (Tony Leung Chiu-wai) is a subtly effective Marvel villain with a compelling family backstory; he is a cinematic antagonist with the most idealism and righteous sense of purpose since Bill the Butcher in ""Gangs of New York"".

Michelle Yeoh as Shang-Chi's aunt Jiang Nan has again some great fighting scenes which stand up to her wonderful performance in ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"". Overall this movie has great fighting scenes, extraordinary effects, especially the flying dragons which are delightful to watch. Highly recommended for everyone who likes superheroes and a touch of mysterious fairytales.","The charm of this movie comes from the setting of the main characters, showing a reflection of today's world, where Asian culture and the way of life in the west creates an environment of searching for one's own identity and place - this is where we meet Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) first.

1580,1580,Best thing in the MCU Phase 4 so far. At least you don't leave it full of disappointment that gets worse the more you think about it.,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is the first entry in MCU Phase 4 with a completely new superhero, an origin story, and is about Shang-Chi, son of a powerful man who has control of the ten rings as well as having an organization of the same name. Living a normal life, his world is turned upside down when the past he has left behind comes back to bite him. Not gonna lie, I wasn't hoping much from this movie considering how disappointing Phase 4 has been but to my surprise, this turned out to be the most entertaining entry in this Post-Infinity Saga so far, particularly because I didn't leave it filled with a layer of disappointment that gets worse the more you think about it.

It's not groundbreaking or different from what the MCU has given us before, especially when it comes to origin stories. In fact, it feels very reminiscent of the earlier movies that came in this cinematic universe following a lot of the same formula, part of the reason I enjoyed it as it reminded me of the good ole days where I was genuinely hyped about the MCU and getting introduced to all these superheroes without having any solid comic-book reading history. It's the usual Marvel schtick with a different skin but with good enough execution in certain parts that you get a steady flow of entertainment and hardly any major frustrations, if at all, from the entire 130 mins runtime.

What I enjoyed the most was the action sequences, which were predominantly hand-to-hand combat and weaponry based kung-fu. With good choreography and cinematography, fewer cuts, non-shaky cam, and the actors performing a lot of the combat themselves, it was thrilling. The accompanying soundtrack was nice too with a mix of modern and East Asian tracks that flowed well with the action.

The story itself, while ending up with the usual end-of-the-world trope that so many superhero flicks have, wasn't bad either. It was cool to see this side of the world in this cinematic universe and not having a typical Human baddie was nice as well.

However, the writing was still not particularly good as the movie sorely lacked urgency and stakes. There wasn't that OOOMPH that would have propelled this movie to higher tiers. It played safe and light with a lot of predictable elements so you just sorta experience the events which play out mostly how you'd expect. The dialogue could have been a lot better as well with the same story beats the movie employs and would have given characters a lot more depth where the emotional moments could have been hard-hitting. The titular character himself felt lacking in energy and charisma.

I did like the overall ensemble and how it all came together in the end even if full of cliches. I was worried about Awkwafina's character Katie and that she'll be annoying for the rest of the movie but I was pleasantly surprised by her relationship with Shang-Chi played by Simu Lu, it was sweet. I'm glad the humour wasn't in your face throughout and took a backseat at certain points as MCU lately has developed a habit of injecting way too much of their brand of humour and it hasn't worked for me. Not saying the comedy here was great as some of it fell flat on its face but some of it did work.

All in all, despite its problems, despite the movie playing it safe, despite it being predictable, I had fun. I do hope Simu Lu gives a stronger performance wherever his character shows up next because compared to other MCU heroes, Shang-Chi himself is among the lower end for me for now. If you like the MCU, then certainly give this a go. If nothing else, you'll probably enjoy the action. And if I were to rate it, I'd give it a 6.8/10.","Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is the first entry in MCU Phase 4 with a completely new superhero, an origin story, and is about Shang-Chi, son of a powerful man who has control of the ten rings as well as having an organization of the same name.

Black Widow was okay as a stand-alone picture and the same can be said by Shang-Chi. It is not a bad film.

I know I am not the target group for these films so probably that's the reason I'm getting bored by most MCU films. So..if you are looking for 2 hours of fun but utterly forgettable entertainment...this is okay. But then again; there are countless other films out there that can provide the same.","Why continue?

1590,1590,Not a previous phase movie,"I decided to write this review after watching Black Wodow, Eternals and Shang Chi. I understand the need to make a diversity movie, but all in all, aside from special effects, this movie can be easily replaced by almost any Chinese martial arts production with high budget. It's not a Marvel movie, it's a martial arts movie with Mystic elements.

It's actually good in its own way, but it certainly doesn't get that Marvel feel in all the previous movies. Neither do Eternals. Nor even the Black Widow, despite glorious Scarlett Johannson.

I really wanted to see more of the same as the endgame, and not to invent the formula from scratch.

1596,1596,Nothing original,"It feels like a mash up of about 10 old movies anc 20 plots weaved into one film, for me I didn't enjoy it very much, there were positives but overall I didn't leave feeling like I'd seen something that special. It didn't feel like a marvel film, I'm not against diversity or going in different directions but it just wasn't a film I loved or would see again. The characters were bland and uninspiring, the humour was ok but bit same old same old and the plot which I'd guess you'd call the main theme felt a bit daft.

The cgi was awesome, graphics, choreography and costumes all really nice, parts were genuinely beautiful but if the film ain't doing much for me that doesn't matter.

Think a lot would hinge on whether you got this gimmick or liked it, I didn't, they were cool for set pieces and what they wanted to achieve in the movie but I just felt they weren't something I thought was interesting or that impressive.

It was always going one way, it was pretty predictable and I didn't feel or believe the emotion as I found the story a bit stupid, it just felt directionless and they were trying to do so much whilst achieving very little.

It felt long to, much longer than the run time, it just wasn't a film I'd recommend and it was one I felt disappointed.

I maybe backwards though as everyone's saying this makes up for black widow, I don't get that, I thought black widow was brilliant. Way better than this.

The cgi was awesome, graphics, choreography and costumes all really nice, parts were genuinely beautiful but if the film ain't doing much for me that doesn't matter.

Think a lot would hinge on whether you got this gimmick or liked it, I didn't, they were cool for set pieces and what they wanted to achieve in the movie but I just felt they weren't something I thought was interesting or that impressive.

It was always going one way, it was pretty predictable and I didn't feel or believe the emotion as I found the story a bit stupid, it just felt directionless and they were trying to do so much whilst achieving very little.

It felt long to, much longer than the run time, it just wasn't a film I'd recommend and it was one I felt disappointed.

I maybe backwards though as everyone's saying this makes up for black widow, I don't get that, I thought black widow was brilliant. Way better than this.

Also it seems if it's Asian and a bit funny everyone calls awkwafina."
1597,1597,Kindergarten storyline,"I can't believe this came from Marvel, the storyline was so basic. And sometime actually said this was better than Black Panther? Must be watching a different movie. I mean if you have a dragon, why don't you just use it to kill your father, end of story. And apart from jumping around and punching people hard, the rings are basically useless. Like I said, basic script. The least said about this, the better.","I can't believe this came from Marvel, the storyline was so basic. And sometime actually said this was better than Black Panther?

1599,1599,Kung Fu Romp with Lame Story,"Its your typical high flying kung fu action script layered on top of an uninteresting story with no depth.

The main character and his sidekick were tiring to watch because they are adults acting like teens. They never managed to become interesting. The acting however was fine so its not a knock on the actors themselves but the script was kiddie. They were clearly going for the teen demographic with this movie.

I personally couldnt enjoy it. Marvel in general, hasnt really produced a film that I enjoyed in a very long time so its not really surprising. This might be fun if you are younger but for adults who have seen or read a lot of stories, this is probably not good.","Its your typical high flying kung fu action script layered on top of an uninteresting story with no depth.

The action is the films biggest plus point. It's where the best scenes are on show, the choreography is brilliant alongside its kung fu/John Wick style fights.

The visuals are typical of a Marvel film, solid as always. The film however lost its emotional resonance through its writing. The heart of a film mainly comes from the screenplay and I felt the writing was slightly lazy in parts and that heart faded.

It's neither a perfect nor terrible film, it's a solid one that I enjoyed, even if it was hard to truly gravitate towards the characters.

Visuals were top notch, it was colorful, vibrant, coherent and just pure insanity at the third act.

The villain isn't bad per say but is just really bland and unoriginal, it actually gets really predictable towards the end. Also the ending is just absolutely crazy. Now don't get me wrong crazy is absolutely great for an over the top movie like this but it did take me out of the movie. The first section of the movie tho! AMAZING!

Every single actor was good, and none made me cringe, as plenty of MCU characters usually do because they're written by bad writers.

I'm not a fan of Awkwafina, but she was wonderful, and I actually felt emotional connections to characters. The runtime was ideal, and the entire production design was incredible, as was the CGI, which made this into an epic martial arts experience. I enjoyed this movie from start to finish because it's not a regular Marvel/superhero flick, it's a real adventure. One of the few MCU movies I might rewatch once or twice.

Hell No !! There are atleast 3 better origin stories existing. But there's a lot of good things Shang-Chi does that differentiates this film from the normal MCU film. The Visuals are breathtakingly beautiful and unlike any MCU film I have seen. The tone of the film resembles Chinese Action Movies more rather than MCU which is so refreshing. The first few fight scenes are just incredible and got me super hyped but the quality falls in the later scenes when it becomes a CGI Monsterfest. The story is very predictable and full of narration and exposition. At its core its a very emotional family drama but the dialogues are not powerful enough to dig really deep and I craved for that in so many scenes. The performances are solid with Awkwafina and Ben Kingsley providing great Comedic Relief, but the standout is Tony Leung. He generates such level of empathy and emotional suffering with just his eyes, He is the Legend after all. Overall its a really fun watch, but not as great as people are shouting it is.","First of all, I think People are overhyping this film a bit like they did Black Panther.

It was good to see a major blockbuster from a non-USA centric point of view. Shang Chi's best movements are it's timed humour and martial arts fight scenes. The ending of the movie is a theme park ride with eye soaring VFX of two dragons which are supposedy fighting but we don't know it due to excess use of colour.

On the whole Shang Chi is a typical summer blockbuster which is bound to entertain all demographics but it's linear storyline and under utilisation of Tony Leung Chiu Wai's talent is a bit underwhelming.","It was hard to believe that Destin Daniel Cretton directed this film, which is a complete contrast from his previous work.

The second problem is the fact that Shang-Chi itself is not an interesting character as far as this movie treats him. He surely has potential and it is clear that Marvel will be high on him in the future and I still have hope but in this movie I think I preferred at least four characters more than him and he is the protagonist. And finally the plot has various holes, especially regarding the Ten Rings as a criminal organization. The visuals and the action are good but it wasn't enough for me to like this movie.

1623,1623,"Decent, but most DEFINITELY overrated. The novelty is wearing thin for Marvel","If you rarely are disappointed with Marvel films, and you consider yourself a big fan of them, then you will most likely enjoy this film. It's certainly better than a few of the last installments (by a small margin), but this film is proof to all others that there really aren't any fresh ideas anymore, and the Marvel antics are getting rather boring.

You have good guy who is lackluster in personality, has some family issues, turns out he's a very important guy in the world, has some impressive abilities which he hones, discovers things about himself, has someone close to him betray him, has to make some big decisions, engages in climactic fight, the end.

These movies are so cookie-cutter, all Marvel is now, is predictable pomp and circumstance with flashy lights and SOME, not many, redeeming qualities. Let's start with those first:

Choreography. There are some slick-nasty moves in most of the fight scenes. Action scenes, and entertaining fights is certainly one thing Marvel rarely disappoints.

Humor. Another typical trait of a Marvel film, you get some good chuckles here and there. However without Awkwafina, this trait would be almost non-existent. And this is coming from someone who usually doesn't care for the smarky humor of the latest generations. But she is rather funny without being TOO annoying and sarcastic.

Special effects and cinematography. Solid work, obviously they didn't downsize their SFX department. But compared to the bar set by previous movies in the Marvel world, it's not all that impressive.

On to the unflattering traits:

Story. WOOF. Predictable through and through, don't expect much of anything here. They could easily have held a writing competition at any average middle school for the students to write a basic action movie script, and the storyline for this film would have probably been the entry from the kid who won 3rd place.

Characters. Aside from a a select few, the characters are as flat as a pancake in a hydraulic press.

The humor and the action. While I mentioned this earlier as a pro, over time, it all got old towards the end. The attempts at humor starting falling short of the goal, and the action became stale.

It's about time to wrap up this dynasty of Marvel movies and move onto something else before it starts to smell like discarded scraps of reused ideas, and accumulate maggots of banality.","If you rarely are disappointed with Marvel films, and you consider yourself a big fan of them, then you will most likely enjoy this film.
